
Source Code for Windows Version of the Level 9 Interpreter
----------------------------------------------------------

Included in this archive is complete source code to rebuild the Windows version of
the Level 9 interpreter, version 5.1. This source has been tested with Microsoft
Visual C++. However, it should be relatively easy to get it to compile with others.

If using Visual C++, just load the project and build it. To compile with other
compilers, the first stage is to build the class library. All the .cpp files in
"classlib" need to be built into a single library. The interpreter can now be
built by compiling "level9.c", "lev9win.cpp" and linking with the class library.

Note that the 16 bit Windows version is no longer supported. None of the 16 bit
code has been removed however, so it may be possible to get a 16 bit version to
build.
