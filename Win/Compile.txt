
Source Code for Windows Version of the Level 9 Interpreter
----------------------------------------------------------

Included in this archive is complete source code to rebuild the 32 bit versions of
the Level 9 interpreter, version 3.0. This source has been tested with Microsoft
Visual C++. However, it should be relatively easy to get it to compile with others.

Note that the 16 bit Windows version is no longer supported. None of the 16 bit
code has been removed however, so it may be possible to get a 16 bit version to
build. Should you suceed in doing so, please get in touch with us.

To compile, the first stage is to build the class library. For Visual C++, open
the project in the "classlib" directory. For other compilers, all the .cpp files
in "classlib" need to be built into a single library. The interpreter can now be
built by compiling "level9.c", "lev9win.cpp" and linking with the class library.
