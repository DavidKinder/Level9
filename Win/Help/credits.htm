<h1>Credits</h1>
The Level9 interpreter was originally written by Glen Summers. The changes for 3.0 were made
by <a href="mailto:davidk.kinder@virgin.net">David Kinder</a> with additional code from
Alan Staniforth and Simon Baldwin. For 4.0, David Kinder integrated the various bitmap decoders,
but all the difficult work was done by Alan Staniforth and Dieter Baron. Alan also supplied the
BBC B bitmap changes for 4.1.
<p>
Help, testing and information on the various Level 9 formats was provided by Paul David Doherty.
Testing of the fix for Lancelot in 4.1 was performed by Guido Mureddu.
