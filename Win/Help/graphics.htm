<h1>Graphics</h1>
The first games from Level 9 were text only, but later games included
line-drawn graphics, and then bitmap graphics for the last games. These
graphics are supported by some versions of the interpreter, including
the Windows version.
<p>
On some platforms the line-drawn graphics were placed into separate
files (For example, in the Amiga release of "Jewels of Darkness" the
game is in "gamedata.dat" and the graphics in "picture.dat".). In order
to show the pictures the graphics file should be given the same name as
the game data file, but with an extension of ".pic", ".cga" or ".hrc"
(the latter two being used for graphics files in MS-DOS Level 9
releases).
<p>
If no line-drawn graphics file is specified, Level 9 will search the
given game data file for graphics data. This is useful when the game
data is a Spectrum SNA snapshot or a similar memory dump of an emulator.
<p>
The last Level 9 games use bitmap graphics. The interpreter can display
the bitmap graphics from C64, Amiga, Atari ST, MS-DOS, Apple Macintosh,
BBC B, Amstrad CPC and Spectrum +3 versions of the games (though for the
last three, there is currently no way to extract the A-code game data in
a usable form).
<p>
The graphics files contain a number somewhere in the file name, and
there may also be a title picture with a different file name. The
interpreter searches for suitably named graphics files using the
following rules. In all cases copy the graphics and title files to the
same directory as the game.
