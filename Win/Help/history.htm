    <td width=60 valign=top><b>v5.0</b></td>
    <td>
V1 games are also now supported.<br>
The input logic now correctly handles commas and full stops in the user's
input for v3 or later games.<br>
The input logic now allows hyphens and apostrophes to be input, which is
needed for some v2 games.<br>
The dictionary listing for v2 games no longer has junk on the end.<br>
The graphics detection algorithm has been improved, so that it now
correctly finds graphics in all known games.<br>
A difference in the logic between the v2 and v3 line-drawn
graphics has been implemented, which corrects the scaling for
some v2 graphics.<br>
Added #seed and #play meta commands.

The interpreter now gives you a reasonable amount of time to enter the Lenslok code in protected games,
and also tells you what the code should be.
