<h1>Meta Commands and Menus</h1>
Level9 supports several meta commands, which can be entered on the input
line. These commands are handled by the interpreter rather than being
passed to the game. They are:
<p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
  <tr>
    <td width=100 valign=top>#save</td>
    <td>Saves out a game position directly, bypassing any prompting
(such as for disk changes).</td>
  </tr>
  <tr><td height=16></td></tr>
  <tr>
    <td width=100 valign=top>#restore</td>
    <td>Loads in a saved position directly, bypassing any protection code within the game.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr><td height=16></td></tr>
  <tr>
    <td width=100 valign=top>#quit</td>
    <td>Quits the current game.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr><td height=16></td></tr>
  <tr>
    <td width=100 valign=top>#cheat</td>
    <td>Tries to bypass the copy protection code which asks for a specific word.
This is done by trying every word in the game's dictionary. On a slow machine, this can take a long time.
</td>
  <tr><td height=16></td></tr>
  <tr>
    <td width=100 valign=top>#dictionary</td>
    <td>Lists the game dictionary. Press a key to stop the listing and return to the input line.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr><td height=16></td></tr>
  <tr>
    <td width=100 valign=top>#picture</td>
    <td>If graphics are available, shows the picture specified as a number after the picture command,
e.g. "#picture 520".
</td>
  </tr>
  <tr><td height=16></td></tr>
  <tr>
    <td width=100 valign=top>#seed</td>
    <td>Sets the seed of the random number generator to the value given, e.g. "#seed 42". This will
make randomness within the game predictable, which is useful for testing.
</td>
  </tr>
  <tr><td height=16></td></tr>
  <tr>
    <td width=100 valign=top>#play</td>
    <td>Prompts the user for a text file from which to read further input from. Input lines are read
from the file until the end is reached, at which point the game reverts to asking the user for input.
</td>
  </tr>
</table>
