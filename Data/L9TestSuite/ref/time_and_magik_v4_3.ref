Welcome to the Price of Magik, the third part of Time and Magik, copyright
(c) 1988 from Level 9 and Mandarin. 
 
The Red Moon crystal was recovered and guarded for many years, gaining
intensity. But its power proved too tempting for one magician; Myglar by
name. Thinking to have eternal life, he stole the moon and locked himself
away. One last hero would have to defeat this last threat to history and
recover the crystal, even if it meant paying the price of magik...
(This version allows you to use RAM SAVE and RAM RESTORE to save a position
in memory, and UNDO to retrace your steps). 
You are on a dark and winding drive just to the south of a house, whose
venerable magnificence has decayed through years of abandonment and neglect.
It stands, desolate and hollow-windowed, a malevolent shadow of its former
self. Gnarled creepers cling desperately to the walls, almost completely
enveloping the building. A huge carved door with a blackened brass knocker
in the shape of a griffin's head is set in the middle of the sprawling
facade. You can see a vine. 
What now? W 
You are in a rickety woodshed which is slowly sinking into the dank marsh
that has grown up and engulfed the grounds of the house. Its timbers are
rotting - livid patches of mold and rank orange fungus dot its sides - and
the air is redolent with decay. You can see a candle and a woodpile. 
What now? EXAMINE WOODPILE 
Neatly stacked, all ready for a fire. Underneath it is something nasty. 
What now? EXAMINE NASTY 
The nasty suddenly discovers a little hole in the floorboards, and with a
chirruping cry of delight slithers into it. 
Your sanity is shaken. 
What now? GET CANDLE
Taken. 
Your sanity is shaken. 
What now? EXAMINE CANDLE 
Made of tallow. It is burning weakly. It is less than half burnt. 
What now? LIGHT WOODPILE 
The woodpile bursts into flames and within moments is reduced to ashes. 
What now? EXTINGUISH CANDLE 
The candle goes out. 
What now? GET ASHES
Taken. 
Your sanity is shaken. 
What now? W 
You are on a herb garden on an insect-infested mound which rises through the
marsh mist. A few stunted plants survive miserably among the stark, skeletal
remains of their fellows. Droplets of water gather sadly on their leaves,
before dripping quietly onto the cold ground below. You can see an elder
cross, a mandrake and some eyebright flowers. 
What now? TAKE ALL 
Eyebright flowers: taken. 
Mandrake: the mandrake screams in terror as you grab its leaves, flailing
ineffectually at your hands with its tendrils. Do you want to continue? YES 
You brutally wrench it from the ground, and some things fall out of its
roots. 
Skull: taken. 
Knucklebone: taken. 
Elder cross: taken. 
Your sanity is shaken. 
What now? EXAMINE ALL 
Eyebright flowers: a magical plant which is rumoured to miraculously improve
vision when rubbed into the eyes. 
Mandrake: a vile weed, shaped like a man daubed by a maniacal toddler and
used in many nefarious necromantic dabblings. 
Skull: decorated across the forehead with black stars. 
Knucklebone: obviously intended for strange rituals, because symbols have
been burned into each side. Around it is a ring. 
Ashes: the remains of the woodpile. 
Candle: made of tallow. It is less than half burnt. 
Elder cross: a weird wooden cross, round and hollow, its crossbar lashed on
with dried grass. 
What now? EXAMINE RING 
Set with a beautiful, solitaire diamond. 
What now? DROP MANDRAKE
Dropped. 
What now? REMOVE RING FROM KNUCKLEBONE
OK.

What now? U 
You are on a vine whose strong, gnarled branches have intertwined, clutching
at each others' throats and digging their short, dry roots into the stone
walls. Their cankered bark is cracked and seamed; covered with slippery grey
lichen. 
What now? U
You are on a vine, pushing through a tangled mass of decaying tendrils. 
What now? U 
You are on the top of the vine which clings precariously to the crumbling
wall at the house roof's edge. 
What now? U 
You are on a sloping roof, in weak, watery sunlight that filters uneasily
through the mist, glinting on the slick grey slates. 
What now? U
You are on a roof, high above the dismal marshes and mist-covered plain.
Black skeletons of trees rise up through the grey blanket of mist that
obscures the grounds of the house, to gleam in the half-light.

wreckage of ages. You can see a full-length mirror. Your sanity is shaken.

You are in a shadowy alcove to the north of the attic, where the air is
musty, and smells of pigeons and mothballs. You can see a wardrobe. There is
a feeling of magik. Your sanity is shaken. 
What now? EXAMINE WARDROBE
It is made of elegantly carved mahogany, with mother-of-pearl inlays. In it
are some robes.

despondently towards the floor, its rafters humped and shapeless beneath the
wreckage of ages. You can see a full-length mirror.

the rest of the mirror shimmers and disappears.

despondently towards the floor, its rafters humped and shapeless beneath the

You are in a recess, less than a metre deep, which was hidden behind the
mirror. You can see a prism. 
What now? GET PRISM
Taken. 
Your sanity is shaken. 
What now? EXAMINE PRISM 
Shaped like a pyramid and bends light at a sharp angle, refracting it into
rainbow colours. The word "XAM" is cut into its base. 
Your sanity is shaken.

despondently towards the floor, its rafters humped and shapeless beneath the
wreckage of ages. 
What now? W
You are in the west of an attic filled with the accumulated junk of
centuries. Here, old books, broken artefacts and cracked pottery vies with a
tumble of moth-eaten clothes and trunks, stuffed to overflowing with the
fashions of a bygone age. Mice scuttle among the boxes, their small feet
clicking on the floorboards, and somewhere a rat gnaws frantically. Pallid
light slinks through a dormer window to the north, lighting the dancing dust
motes and laying a sickly patina over all it touches. You can see a cage. 
What now? GET CAGE 
Taken. 
What now? SW
You are in the doorway to an attic, bare boards beneath your feet. 
What now? SE 
You are in an office, festooned with grimy cobwebs that cover the few pieces
of furniture, giving everything a slumped appearance. You can see a table. 
What now? EXAMINE TABLE 
It has been sorely misused over the years, and is covered with gouges hacked
in it by the over-enthusiastic wielding of a meat cleaver. There are several
sets of initials as well, and the word "MAD" carved in chunky, rough-cut
letters. On it is a scroll and a knife. 
Your sanity is shaken. 
What now? GET SCROLL
Taken. 
What now? GET KNIFE
Taken. 
What now? READ SCROLL 
Part of an ancient magik training manual. It is old and faded, but you can
just make out: '...to use a spell, hold the... ..nd "CAST spell", "CAST
spell AT target" or "CAST spell ---- direction)", then ta...'.

A magnificent oak door with embossed knobs on every panel. The word "ESP" is
moulded roughly into the brass knocker. 
Your sanity is shaken.

Rat-a-tat-tat! 
You can hear vile slithering noises coming towards you.

OK. 
The squelching noises are getting closer.

The door closes behind you. 
You are in an entrance hall of the ruined mansion; an imposing vestibule
with a front door hewn from mighty oak planks. You can see a postcard. The
noises die away. 
What now? EXAMINE POSTCARD 
From the sorting office and reads: "Following the mysterious disappearances
of three postmen working in this area, we have suspended deliveries locally.
Post may be collected from the sorting office. We apologise for any
inconvenience". 
Somewhere nearby, you hear a clock strike. 
What now? NW
You are in an entrance hall panelled in mellow golden wood. Elegant wooden
chairs stand against the far wall, and an inlaid table in the centre of the
room holds a beautiful vase filled with dead flowers. Ornamental candelabra
stand on small shelves at regular intervals along the walls. All the windows
are firmly closed and shuttered. You can see a grandmother clock. Your
sanity is shaken.

An antique - and it's ticking. The time is 6: 3 am. In it is a pendulum.

What now? W
You are in a butler's passage, though quite how you know this is hard to
tell. It looks pretty much like any other wood-panelled passage and smells
of stale, over-cooked cabbage. 
What now? W
You are in a rock-walled room, where the air trembles with the far-off boom
of rushing waters. Yet the room itself is dry and warm, and a pleasant smell
of old polish and metal-cleaner hangs in the air. You can see a picture of
Stonehenge. 
What now? NW
You are on a yellow river which roils between the walls of a deep chasm, its
waters swift and turbid. It lashes at the boulders upon its dismal shores
with a booming roar, echoing and re-echoing through endless tunnels. 
What now? N
You are in a distorted junction where every plane runs where it will, with a
total disregard for correct interspacial relationships. The angles where
they join are insane, eye-wrenching collisions between walls and floors,
walls and ceilings, ceilings and floors - that defy comprehension and leave
the observer's mind reeling. 
What now? NE
You are in an ante-chapel filled with glowing red light, its walls carved
with scenes from the life of Zog. Wooden pews face the alcove to the north,
and a bunch of dead flowers lies in a dusty heap in one corner. There is a
feeling of magik. 
What now? N 
You are in an ante-alcove, its arched entrance engraved with indecipherable
runes. From a brass curtain-rod, hang rich, blue-velvet drapes. You can see
an altar. On it is a red moon. There is a feeling of magik. 
What now? TOUCH MOON 
As soon as you touch the moon, a thrill runs through your body, and you feel
very youthful. You recoil in surprise.

What now? N
You are in a better hole, where the air is dry and the earthen walls are
sealed with a rough coating of yellow clay. A cool breeze stirs the air, and
from far, far away, a faint rumbling boom echoes with the sound of running
water. 
What now? N
You are in a hole, hacked from the damp earth, and shored up with blackened
timbers. Roots trail down from the ceiling, their tendrils groping for
moisture in the empty air, and wriggling bundles of pale, eyeless worms
squirm upon the floor. 
What now? UP
You are in a stairway, its cast-iron rungs clattering beneath your feet, the
banister smooth and cold under your grasping hand. 
What now? E
You are in an oak panelled corridor. 
What now? N
You are in a misty corridor, where strange lights glint and sparkle, teasing
the eye, and phantom voices whisper in your ears. There is a feeling of
magik. 
What now? NE
You are in a marble hall, its vaulted ceiling supported by graceful columns
that seem at first glance to be marred by ugly brown stains, but which, on
closer inspection, prove to be wooden pillars covered with peeling paper
that has been painted to simulate marble. The walls, too, are paper-covered,
their crimson and green mottlings hiding rough granite blocks. 
What now? NE 
You are on a roof garden, cold and silent, hemmed in by grey stone and made
dark and wet by the dank mist. A few bright herbs cling to life; lonely
survivors from the time when the sun still shone and caring hands tended the
garden. You can see a valerian plant and a sprig of wolfsbane. 
What now? GET VALERIAN
Taken. 
Your sanity is shaken. 
What now? EXAMINE VALERIAN 
A magik herb with long-lasting, purplish flowers. 
What now? GET WOLFSBANE

You are in the north tower. Across from you and to one side lies the dismal
roof garden, and above you a tower ascends into darkness. You can see a
rope. There is a feeling of magik. 
What now? UP 
You gingerly climb the ancient rope, your hands slipping every now and then
on its greasy surface. Ding. Dong etc. 
You are in a belfry where mist curls sleepily through the slatted shutters,
chilling the air, and where rotting floorboards creak and moan beneath your
feet. Stray shafts of light quiver through the gloom, crawling down dusty
beams and rafters and slithering over the piles of dust that lie everywhere.
You can see a blood-sucking bat and a bell. You can hear vile slithering
noises coming towards you. 
What now? GET BAT
Taken. 
It goes "peep peep". The squelching noises are getting closer. 
What now? EXAMINE BELL 
Cast from several tonnes of bronze and covered with bat-droppings.

gloom. You pass out from sheer terror. Your sanity is shaken.

What now? SE
You are in a room with a large table. The walls are hung with faded
pictures, some done in oils, some in watercolour, some in gouache, yet all
depict war, and the horrors of war. Wherever you look, cannons flare and
swords flash. You can see a wargame. The blood-sucking bat stretches its
wings. 
What now? EXAMINE WARGAME 
A model which re-enacts, through endless repetitions, the massacre in the
council chamber which brought Myglar to power.

dank and fusty. The blood-sucking bat goes "peep peep". 
What now? W
You are in the yard below a huge gallows in a small courtyard paved with
stone. Forbidding grey walls tower up on every side, almost obscuring the
sky far above, and gargoyles leer down upon you, their stone eyes staring. A
few sad weeds grow in the cracks between the stones and the gallows loom,
huge and silent, over all. There is a feeling of magik.

the stagnant air. Its ancient panels sound strangely hollow. The
blood-sucking bat eyes a vein in your neck. 
What now? PUSH PANEL 
You try all the panels in turn, working from the north end, southwards.
About two thirds of the way along, one of them gives slightly under your
groping fingers, you hear a quiet "snick", and the whole group of panels
around the one you have pushed swing open. You have found a secret door. 
The blood-sucking bat goes "peep peep".

atmosphere of foreboding hangs over the place. You can see a lever and a

mellow gold with age. They still smell faintly of scented wood. The

like the bridge of a ship. The walls are panelled with varnished teak, and
the same wood covers the ceiling and floor. A table juts out from one wall,
bearing a huge sheet of glass under which complicated charts are displayed.
All the fittings are of brass, and a ship's wheel stands between the table
and a small galley, whose stove has been lovingly black-leaded.
Leather-covered benches line the walls. 
What now? SW 
You are in a cellar, still dry and cool, its contents well-preserved, though
all around it has fallen into neglect and ruin. You can see some chests. 
What now? EXAMINE CHESTS 
The chests are coloured black, brown, red, orange, yellow, green, blue,
violet, grey and white. 
What now? The colour of the chest containing the salt is randomly allocated

vases on its delicate shelves dusty and forgotten. You can see a tapestry.

A picture of a scrawny female healer, plying her wares in a crowded
market-place. 
The blood-sucking bat stretches its wings. 
What now? E
You are on a spiral stair, its cold stone steps hollowed by long usage, and
with odd symbols and obscure grinning faces carved into the walls. Every now
and then a small, slitted window lets light in, but the walls are too thick,
and the windows too high for you to see anything but the dismal grey sky
through them. 
What now? D
You are in an alcove to the east of the painting gallery. It is a small
space, hung with long velvet curtains in a comfortable shade of wine red. A
stone staircase rises up through its ceiling. 
What now? W
You are in a hall hung with paintings which show desolate, red-rocked
landscapes, or bowls of fruit and dead fowl, their paint marred by a network
of fine cracks where the surface has aged and dried. Some are of people:
men, women and children, all of whom have the same aquiline nose and pointed
jawline. Many of them have eyes of the same curious shade of green. 
 
One, a woman, is depicted with her yellow hair flying out behind her, her
robes whipped around her slender form by the wind. Her green eyes are
narrowed and fire flies from her outstretched hands. You can see a warped
portrait. The blood-sucking bat eyes a vein in your neck. 
What now? NW 
You are in a bone chamber. The walls are pocked with tiny alcoves, each
holding a neat pile of bones with a skull set neatly on top. Other bones lie
scattered haphazardly on the floor. You can see some bones. There is a

You are in a rough-hewn tunnel, carved from the living rock, its edges still
jagged and raw. Stones and other debris litter the floor. 
What now? SE
You are in a panelled corridor with walls intricately carved from elm wood.
Most depict the pastoral life of some vaguely medieval era, and chubby
peasants sport amid the summer hedges, rampant with sukebind. One of them
shows an old man driving four cows to the milking, with but ten legs and
one-and-a-half horns between them. You can see a sword. 
What now? GET SWORD

The door closes behind you. 
You are on a dark and winding drive just to the south of a house, whose
venerable magnificence has decayed through years of abandonment and neglect.
It stands, desolate and hollow-windowed, a malevolent shadow of its former
self. Gnarled creepers cling desperately to the walls, almost completely
enveloping the building. A huge carved door with a blackened brass knocker
in the shape of a griffin's head is set in the middle of the sprawling
facade. You can see a vine.

You are on a herb garden on an insect-infested mound which rises through the
marsh mist. A few stunted plants survive miserably among the stark, skeletal

knucklebone, a skull and a mandrake. The blood-sucking bat eyes a vein in

Time passes. The blood-sucking bat goes "peep peep". The existing FLY spell
wears off. 
What now? NE
You are in a white-wood corridor, its walls lighter than pine, yet turning a
mellow gold with age. They still smell faintly of scented wood. The
blood-sucking bat stretches its wings. 
What now? N
You are in an oak panelled corridor, the smell of decaying wood strong in
the stagnant air. Its ancient panels sound strangely hollow. 
What now? N
You are in a pentagonal room, its walls hung with red velvet, with strange
signs painted upon the floor. A low humming fills the air, almost beyond the
range of human hearing. There is a feeling of magik. The blood-sucking bat
eyes a vein in your neck. 
What now? NE
You are in a small landing, sunk in gloom, its faded carpet and hangings
dank and fusty. 
What now? S
You are in a musty hall, its high walls cloth-covered, the statuettes and
vases on its delicate shelves dusty and forgotten. You can see a tapestry.
The blood-sucking bat goes "peep peep". 
What now? E
You are on a spiral stair, its cold stone steps hollowed by long usage, and
with odd symbols and obscure grinning faces carved into the walls. Every now
and then a small, slitted window lets light in, but the walls are too thick,
and the windows too high for you to see anything but the dismal grey sky
through them. The blood-sucking bat stretches its wings. 
What now? D
You are in an alcove to the east of the painting gallery. It is a small
space, hung with long velvet curtains in a comfortable shade of wine red. A
stone staircase rises up through its ceiling. The blood-sucking bat eyes a
vein in your neck. 
What now? W
You are in a hall hung with paintings which show desolate, red-rocked
landscapes, or bowls of fruit and dead fowl, their paint marred by a network
of fine cracks where the surface has aged and dried. Some are of people:
men, women and children, all of whom have the same aquiline nose and pointed
jawline. Many of them have eyes of the same curious shade of green. 
 
One, a woman, is depicted with her yellow hair flying out behind her, her
robes whipped around her slender form by the wind. Her green eyes are
narrowed and fire flies from her outstretched hands. You can see a warped
portrait. The blood-sucking bat goes "peep peep". 
What now? NW
You are in a bone chamber. The walls are pocked with tiny alcoves, each
holding a neat pile of bones with a skull set neatly on top. Other bones lie
scattered haphazardly on the floor. There is a feeling of magik. The
blood-sucking bat stretches its wings. 
What now? S
You are in a rough-hewn tunnel, carved from the living rock, its edges still
jagged and raw. Stones and other debris litter the floor. The blood-sucking
bat eyes a vein in your neck. 
What now? SE
You are in a panelled corridor with walls intricately carved from elm wood.
Most depict the pastoral life of some vaguely medieval era, and chubby
peasants sport amid the summer hedges, rampant with sukebind. One of them
shows an old man driving four cows to the milking, with but ten legs and
one-and-a-half horns between them. The blood-sucking bat goes "peep peep". 
What now? S
You are in an elm panelled corridor, its beautiful yellow wood pockmarked
with thousands of little holes. Where a small piece of wood has fallen away,
you can see a heaving mass of tiny beetles. You can see a werewolf. The
blood-sucking bat stretches its wings. 
What now? SW
You are in an entrance hall panelled in mellow golden wood. Elegant wooden
chairs stand against the far wall, and an inlaid table in the centre of the
room holds a beautiful vase filled with dead flowers. Ornamental candelabra
stand on small shelves at regular intervals along the walls. All the windows
are firmly closed and shuttered. You can see a grandmother clock. The
blood-sucking bat eyes a vein in your neck. 
What now? SE
You are in an entrance hall of the ruined mansion; an imposing vestibule
with a front door hewn from mighty oak planks. You can see a postcard. The
blood-sucking bat goes "peep peep". 
What now? W
You are in a butler's passage, though quite how you know this is hard to
tell. It looks pretty much like any other wood-panelled passage and smells
of stale, over-cooked cabbage. 
What now? W
You are in a rock-walled room, where the air trembles with the far-off boom
of rushing waters. Yet the room itself is dry and warm, and a pleasant smell
of old polish and metal-cleaner hangs in the air. You can see a picture of
Stonehenge. 
What now? NW
You are on a yellow river which roils between the walls of a deep chasm, its
waters swift and turbid. It lashes at the boulders upon its dismal shores
with a booming roar, echoing and re-echoing through endless tunnels. The
blood-sucking bat stretches its wings. 
What now? S
You are on a slide of slime which glistens viscidly against the yellow mud.
The air trembles with the far-off boom of rushing waters.

You are in a circular room with a large, circular table in its middle.
Ancient weapons are hung upon the walls, and a great fireplace stands empty

What now? S
You slither down a greasy chute, which slams shut behind you. 
You are in a pentagonal room hung with royal blue velvet curtains. A curious
globe shines with a milky light, illuminating the silver traceries and
arcane figures described upon the floor. 
What now? SW
You slither down a greasy chute, which slams shut behind you. 
You are in a store room, an octagonal room with a low, uneven ceiling.
Splintered boxes litter the floor, their lids ripped off and the contents
vanished. 
What now? SE
You are in the shadow of an altar with an unholy font, carved into foul and
wicked shapes, a grotesque monument to inhuman ingenuity. There is a feeling
of magik. The blood-sucking bat stretches its wings. 
What now? SW
You are in a sloping room whose floor and ceiling curve towards each other
until they meet in an uneven point at the southern end. Here loose stones
have tumbled from the roof, to lie scattered on the floor. 
What now? NW
You are in a red room. Every surface is lacquered a different shade of red,
and any patterns are done in black, so that the effect is hot, dry, and
thirsty. 
What now? NW
You are in a green room. Artificial grass sprouts from every available
surface, and silk flowers nod in a fan-assisted breeze. A broken
pipe,running through the ceiling, presents a fair approximation of rain. The
blood-sucking bat eyes a vein in your neck. 
What now? S
You are in a silvery room. The walls shimmer with an ethereal light, paler
than the gleam of metal, soft as the petals of a china flower. You can see a
picture by moon light. 
What now? S
You are in a winding corridor which twists and turns aimlessly, and
seemingly without any pattern. The walls are made from smooth rock, their
curves so subtle that they must have been the work of masons of the far
distant past. You can see a picture of werewolves. 
What now? W 
You are on some steps made of rickety wood, that climb through a narrow
stone shaft from darkness into darkness. The sound of running water booms
faintly in the distance. You can see a metallic golem. The blood-sucking bat
goes "peep peep". The metallic golem stamps its feet. 
What now? EXAMINE METALLIC GOLEM 
Grins cheerfully, revealing a fortune in gold fillings. It has just passed a
screen test for the leading role in "The Robots are Coming! (Part IX)", and
hasn't killed anyone for at least three days. It looks very uncomfortable in
armour. It is wearing some silver mail. 
The metallic golem flexes its slab-like muscles. 
What now? REMOVE ROBES
OK. 
The blood-sucking bat goes "peep peep". 
What now? GIVE ROBES TO GOLEM 
The golem thanks you curtly and quickly changes into the robes, handing you
the silver mail. 
What now? EXAMINE MAIL
A suit of delicate metal, made from overlapping silver scales. The
breastplate is inscribed "FIN". 
The blood-sucking bat stretches its wings. Your sanity is shaken. 
What now? DOWN
You are on some rickety steps that creak and quiver ominously beneath your
feet. The blood-sucking bat eyes a vein in your neck. Your sanity is shaken.

You are on an ancient boardwalk, which echoes hollow beneath your feet, its
timbers creaking slightly. The blood-sucking bat goes "peep peep". 
What now? SW
You are in a morgue, in pristine condition, its white walls and surfaces
gleaming in the cold air. There is a feeling of magik. The blood-sucking bat
stretches its wings. 
What now? W
You are in a tomb; a great mausoleum, buried beneath the earth. Mouldering
coffins rest on carved stone benches around the room, their timbers rotting.
The lid of one has shattered, leaving its grisly contents exposed. There is
a feeling of magik. 
What now? SE
You are in a stupendous cavern. Quartz crystals sparkle, many-coloured, in
the walls, and delicate stone pillars soar into darkness, towards an unseen
roof. Water cascades over tumescent stone the colour of candy floss, and
babbles melodically across the cavern floor in a little runnel. The
blood-sucking bat eyes a vein in your neck. 
What now? E
You are in a grotto, a small cave, carved by the passage of water long since
gone, into fantastic shapes and hollows. Here is the likeness of a lion's
head; there, a whale sports amid the billowing waves. Crystalline angels
flit beneath the roof, their wings alive with gemstones, and on the floor
below writhe sparkling snakes, each coil the work of a thousand thousand
years. 
What now? SE 
You are in a web cavern, justly named, for a single mighty cobweb stretches
across it, woven from strands as thick as spun steel and suspended from
stalactite to stalagmite. You can see a crowbar and a web. On it is a giant
spider. There is a feeling of magik. It attacks you. The blow strikes your
plate armour (which has 39 stamina points left). The giant spider shuffles
about. The blood-sucking bat stretches its wings. 
What now? CUT WEB 
The web collapses in a sticky heap, and the spider runs away, gibbering with
terror.

You are on the rickety landing stage, which reaches out into the rushing
water, quivering to the rhythm of the waves. You can see a boat. In it is a
ferryman. The ferryman mutters, "Ohhh, me rheumatism! This job will be the
death of me, rowing across this stinking river, day and night, night and
day, in the cold, damp air. Arghhh". 
What now? GIVE CROWBAR 
The ferryman says grudgingly, "I suppose that will do. Get in, Creep". 
What now? HOP IN 
You are standing on the boat. The ferryman yawns broadly. The ferryman pulls
doughtily on his oars and the boat moves quietly through the water. 
You are in the river, flowing from darkness into darkness. It laps against
the gloomy shore, sussurating gently like a still sea at midnight. You can
see a boat. In it is a ferryman. You are standing on the boat. 
What now? CAST FIN AT ME

The ferryman cracks his knuckles. The blood-sucking bat goes "peep peep".

You are on a river bed. The water bubbles past, cool against your sides,
while strange creaks and groanings sound from the depths. You can see a

Marked with the word "SAN", its letters rippling gently in the current. 
Your sanity is shaken.

Time passes. The existing FIN spell wears off. You can't hold your breath
for long enough to read anything. 
You are in the river, flowing from darkness into darkness. It laps against
the gloomy shore, sussurating gently like a still sea at midnight. You can
see a grimoire, a pendulum, a feldspar lens, a valerian plant, a prism, an
elder cross, a candle, a small mirror, a broom, some ashes, a staff, a bag,
a cage, a parchment, some plate armour, a ring, a scroll, a knife, a sword,
a blood-sucking bat, a sprig of wolfsbane, a shovel and a boat. In it is a

What now? N 
You are in a watery tunnel, cold and damp. You can see a colossal bloodworm.
It attacks you. The blow strikes your plate armour (which has 32 stamina
points left). The bat sees the bloodworm, (even he can't miss a thing that
size) and swoops upon it with a happy cry. The bloodworm howls, turns tail
and lollops off into the gloom, hotly pursued by the bat. Unfortunately, the
little pest is back within moments, his small shoulders quivering as he
tries to get his breath. "Lost the fat ***!" he wheezes bitterly. The
blood-sucking bat goes "peep peep".

You are in a temple, beside an altar made of some transparent substance,
warm like perspex but far harder, and filled with colours that no glass
could capture. Wind chimes hang from the ceiling, tinkling melodically like
children's voices. You can see an altar. On it is a talisman. Hanging above
the altar is a weight. There is a feeling of magik. The blood-sucking bat

pretty violently. Now you think you think you can hear the monkey's teeth
chattering. There is a loud crack from the monkey, and something falls off
with a clatter and rolls along the ground. The monkey leaps from your back

You are on a lake shore, where fog swirls ominously: curling around the
black, dead branches of drowned trees which rise like a long-forgotten
nightmare from the still waters. A cold, wordless cry echoes lonely from the
hidden distance. You can see a magik lake. The blood-sucking bat goes "peep
peep". 
What now? EXAMINE LAKE 
A beautiful expanse of sparkling water that shines a tranquil blue under the
watery sky. 
What now? DRINK WATER
Most refreshing. 
The blood-sucking bat stretches its wings. Your sanity is shaken. 
What now? RUB TALISMAN 
There is a flash, and you feel yourself being propelled through space... You
slither down a greasy chute, which slams shut behind you. 
You are in a rock-walled room, where the air trembles with the far-off boom
of rushing waters. Yet the room itself is dry and warm, and a pleasant smell
of old polish and metal-cleaner hangs in the air. You can see a picture of
Stonehenge. 
What now? E
You are in a butler's passage, though quite how you know this is hard to
tell. It looks pretty much like any other wood-panelled passage and smells
of stale, over-cooked cabbage. 
What now? E
You are in an entrance hall of the ruined mansion; an imposing vestibule
with a front door hewn from mighty oak planks. You can see a postcard. The
blood-sucking bat eyes a vein in your neck. 
What now? NW
You are in an entrance hall panelled in mellow golden wood. Elegant wooden
chairs stand against the far wall, and an inlaid table in the centre of the
room holds a beautiful vase filled with dead flowers. Ornamental candelabra
stand on small shelves at regular intervals along the walls. All the windows
are firmly closed and shuttered. You can see a grandmother clock. The
blood-sucking bat goes "peep peep". 
What now? NE
You are in an elm panelled corridor, its beautiful yellow wood pockmarked
with thousands of little holes. Where a small piece of wood has fallen away,
you can see a heaving mass of tiny beetles. You can see a werewolf. 
What now? N
You are in a panelled corridor with walls intricately carved from elm wood.
Most depict the pastoral life of some vaguely medieval era, and chubby
peasants sport amid the summer hedges, rampant with sukebind. One of them
shows an old man driving four cows to the milking, with but ten legs and
one-and-a-half horns between them. 
What now? NW
You are in a rough-hewn tunnel, carved from the living rock, its edges still
jagged and raw. Stones and other debris litter the floor. The blood-sucking
bat stretches its wings. 
What now? N
You are in a bone chamber. The walls are pocked with tiny alcoves, each
holding a neat pile of bones with a skull set neatly on top. Other bones lie
scattered haphazardly on the floor. There is a feeling of magik. 
What now? SE
You are in a hall hung with paintings which show desolate, red-rocked
landscapes, or bowls of fruit and dead fowl, their paint marred by a network
of fine cracks where the surface has aged and dried. Some are of people:
men, women and children, all of whom have the same aquiline nose and pointed
jawline. Many of them have eyes of the same curious shade of green. 
 
One, a woman, is depicted with her yellow hair flying out behind her, her
robes whipped around her slender form by the wind. Her green eyes are
narrowed and fire flies from her outstretched hands. You can see a warped
portrait. 
What now? E
You are in an alcove to the east of the painting gallery. It is a small
space, hung with long velvet curtains in a comfortable shade of wine red. A
stone staircase rises up through its ceiling. The blood-sucking bat eyes a
vein in your neck. 
What now? U
You are on a spiral stair, its cold stone steps hollowed by long usage, and
with odd symbols and obscure grinning faces carved into the walls. Every now
and then a small, slitted window lets light in, but the walls are too thick,
and the windows too high for you to see anything but the dismal grey sky
through them. The blood-sucking bat goes "peep peep". 
What now? W
You are in a musty hall, its high walls cloth-covered, the statuettes and
vases on its delicate shelves dusty and forgotten. You can see a tapestry.
The blood-sucking bat stretches its wings. 
What now? N
You are in a small landing, sunk in gloom, its faded carpet and hangings
dank and fusty. The blood-sucking bat eyes a vein in your neck. 
What now? SW
You are in a pentagonal room, its walls hung with red velvet, with strange
signs painted upon the floor. A low humming fills the air, almost beyond the
range of human hearing. There is a feeling of magik. The blood-sucking bat
goes "peep peep". 
What now? S
You are in an oak panelled corridor, the smell of decaying wood strong in
the stagnant air. Its ancient panels sound strangely hollow. 
What now? PUSH PANEL
You try all the panels in turn, working from the north end, southwards.
About two thirds of the way along, one of them gives slightly under your
groping fingers, you hear a quiet "snick", and the whole group of panels
around the one you have pushed swing open. You have found a secret door. 
The blood-sucking bat stretches its wings. 
What now? NW
You are in an oak panelled corridor. The blood-sucking bat eyes a vein in
your neck. 
What now? N
You are in a misty corridor, where strange lights glint and sparkle, teasing
the eye, and phantom voices whisper in your ears. There is a feeling of
magik. You almost fall over a wheel that some idiot has left lying about.
Fortunately, you regain your balance, but the wheel bowls off out of sight
into the mist. The blood-sucking bat goes "peep peep". 
What now? CAST SPY 
The spell expends itself harmlessly in mid-air. 
You almost fall over a wheel that some idiot has left lying about.
Fortunately, you regain your balance, but the wheel bowls off out of sight

What now? CAST XAM
It's not magik. 
You almost fall over a wheel that some idiot has left lying about.
Fortunately, you regain your balance, but the wheel bowls off out of sight

shaken. 
What now? CAST DED
There is a thunderclap and all nearby magik is neutralized. The existing DED
spell wears off. 
Your sanity is shaken. 
What now? CAST HYP AT BAT
The blood-sucking bat looks at you expectantly. 
You almost fall over a wheel that some idiot has left lying about.
Fortunately, you regain your balance, but the wheel bowls off out of sight
into the mist. It eyes a vein in your neck. Your sanity is shaken. 
What now? BAT TAKE WHEEL
The bat disappears into the mist, then after a short time, reappears,
dragging a wheel that bobs along a few inches off the ground. The bat is
straining fit to bust, its little veins bulging and its ears screwed up with
concentration, but it obeys your command faithfully, and only drops the
wheel when it can see you again - about two inches from the end of your
nose. The wheel lands on your foot. 
What now? GET WHEEL
Taken. 
Your sanity is shaken.

You slither down a greasy chute, which slams shut behind you. 
You are in a winding corridor which twists and turns aimlessly, and
seemingly without any pattern. The walls are made from smooth rock, their
curves so subtle that they must have been the work of masons of the far
distant past. You can see a picture of werewolves. 
What now? N
You are in a silvery room. The walls shimmer with an ethereal light, paler
than the gleam of metal, soft as the petals of a china flower. You can see a
picture by moon light. The blood-sucking bat goes "peep peep". 
What now? N
You are in a green room. Artificial grass sprouts from every available
surface, and silk flowers nod in a fan-assisted breeze. A broken
pipe,running through the ceiling, presents a fair approximation of rain. The
blood-sucking bat stretches its wings. 
What now? SE
You are in a red room. Every surface is lacquered a different shade of red,
and any patterns are done in black, so that the effect is hot, dry, and
thirsty. The blood-sucking bat eyes a vein in your neck. 
What now? N 
You are in a dark room. The atmosphere is heavy, weighing down upon you, as
though the air were charged with mystic power. A low humming begins at the
back of your skull, more felt than heard. You can see a picture of dark
spawn. 
What now? EXAMINE PICTURE 
Of a hellish dark spawn, clawing its way through the black places beneath
the earth. 
The blood-sucking bat goes "peep peep". 
What now? CAST BOM AT PICTURE 
A dark spawn bursts out of the picture. In its frenzy, it breaks a claw on
the frame. 
The dark spawn attacks you. The blow strikes your plate armour (which has 24
stamina points left). The dark spawn flexes its slab-like muscles.

You are in a palatial portico, its pointed roof supported on four huge
columns of figured marble. Two griffins rampant guard the tops of the two
staircases that ascend from the plain below, their mighty wings upraised.
You can see some giant army ants. The blood-sucking bat stretches its wings.

the walls, eerily mocking your footsteps and amplifying the sound of your
breathing. The blood-sucking bat stretches its wings.

gods alternate with the death masks of notables from the "Murderers' Who's
Who". The blood-sucking bat eyes a vein in your neck.

658;a huge stone representation of Myglar. It has tentacles instead of
hands, and a monstrous face whose eyesockets burn darkly beneath a stone
