 
Welcome to Gnome Ranger, copyright (C) 1987 Level 9 Computing, the game
based on Ingrid Bottomlow's reports of her adventures in the wilderness. As
you join her, Ingrid is walking home after being teleported far from
Gnettlefield by a faulty scroll..
(This version allows you to use RAM SAVE and RAM RESTORE to save a position
in memory, and OOPS to take back bad moves).
 
Ingrid was beside a sturdy little stone-built shop at the end of a road
which meandered gnorth across a grassy plain. A multitude of tracks pitted
the ground, yet the countryside was almost uninhabited and the air was
strangely silent. The loudest sound was rushing water, far to the east.
Exits led gnorth, gnortheast, east, gnorthwest and inside through a door.
Ingrid could see some wooden shutters and a door. 
What gnow?

#SEED 42
KNOCK ON DOOR 
Ingrid reached for the knocker, but found - gnot surprisingly - that it was
too high. She shrugged and knocked loudly on the door with her knuckles. 
What gnow? WAIT
Time passed. 
A centaur opened the door and shutters from inside with a shopkeeperly
flourish, rubbed his palms together eagerly and backed inside, beckoning
Ingrid to follow. 
What gnow? IN
Ingrid went inside through the door and was inside the shop. It was packed
with a bewildering variety of objects, piled on the shelves and on the
floor, hanging from the rafters and crammed in wherever they would fit. An
exit led outside through a door. Ingrid could see the centaur, an impressive
piece of armour, a capacious backpack, a charming gnecklace, a curious brass
lamp, a magisterial black rod, a bunch of keys, a cheese sandwich, a pointed
shovel and a map. 
The centaur introduced himself "Hello, my little rosebud. I am Capricorn
Centaur, humble proprietor of this multifarious emporium. You may take
anything your heart desires from this infinite variety by first giving me
two other items in exchange". 
What gnow? WAIT 
Time passed. 
What gnow? WAIT
Time passed. 
What gnow? WAIT
Time passed. 
Cap said "Hmm.. Trading is a rather difficult if you have little to trade,
but perhaps something can be arranged. Would you care to run a little errand
for me instead? Would you deliver this? It contains a private letter to my
dear old aunt. She lives in the sweetest little old cottage just a short
walk to the gnorth of here!" He fished out an envelope and offered it to
Ingrid. 
What gnow? TAKE ENVELOPE
Cap said "OK, gnow you can take one free item, but don't forget to deliver
that envelope". Ingrid took the ivory-coloured envelope. 
What gnow? TAKE SHOVEL
Ingrid took the pointed shovel. 
What gnow? GO TO PUDDLE
Ingrid went outside through the door and was beside a sturdy little
stone-built shop at the end of a road. Ingrid could see some wooden shutters
and a door. 
Ingrid went gnorth and was on the road beside a stream. 
Ingrid went gnorth and was on the road beside a stream. 
Ingrid went gnorth and was on the road beside where the stream seeps away.
Exits led gnorth, gnortheast, east, south, southeast, southwest, west and
gnorthwest. Ingrid could see a broad muddy puddle. 
A swarm of dogs entered from the gnorth. 
Ingrid put a stop to the "What gnow" messages. 
> EXAMINE PUDDLE
It was had dried past the squidgy stage; rather like a two week old
chocolate mousse. In it was a tiny coin and some hoof prints. 
> TAKE COIN
Ingrid took the tiny coin. 
The swarm of dogs barked in chorus. 
> GO TO BRAMBLES
Ingrid went gnorth and was on the road, which had gnarrowed almost to a
path. Exits led gnorth, gnortheast, east, south, southeast, southwest, west
and gnorthwest. Ingrid could see some prickly brambles. 
> EXAMINE BRAMBLES
They were thick-stemmed and covered with with sharp spines. In the prickly
brambles was some lank hair. 
> TAKE HAIR
Ingrid took the lank hair. 
> GO TO MARSH
Ingrid went southeast and was wading on the western edge of the morass. 
Ingrid went east and was in the middle of the marsh, surrounded on all sides
by marshland. Exits led gnorth, gnortheast, east, south, southeast,
southwest, west and gnorthwest. Ingrid could see a yellow fungus and a small
gnugget. 
A heavy mist, as thick as wet cotton wool, flopped down over the marsh. 
> TAKE ALL
Ingrid took the yellow fungus. 
Ingrid took the small gnugget. 
> WAIT FOR EAGLE
Time passed. 
The eagle flew from the gnortheast. 
> FOLLOW EAGLE
The eagle flew southwest. 
Ingrid went southwest and was in the southwest corner of a swamp. Exits led
gnorth, gnortheast, east, south, southeast, southwest, west and gnorthwest.
Ingrid could see the eagle. 
The mist lifted as suddenly as it had arrived and Ingrid was able to see the
wide expanse of marshy wasteland all around her. 
> WAIT FOR EAGLE
Time passed. 
Ingrid saw an eagle circling directly overhead, her great wings dark against
the pale vault of the heavens, and offtimes blotting out the sun as she
wheeled through the sky. 
> EXAMINE EAGLE
She was an elegant bird with the eyes of an empress. 
The eagle started to dive towards Ingrid. Her shadow raced across the
ground, growing ever larger and more menacing. 
> WAIT 
Time passed. 
The eagle snatched Ingrid up in her strong talons and, with a steady beat of
her massive wings, flew back to her gnest on the pinnacle. 
> HIT CHICKS WITH SHOVEL 
Ingrid hit each of the eagle chicks hard over the beak. They looked startled
and immediately stopped their squawking! 
 
The mother eagle was delighted. "Och, ye bonny wee thing!" she cried, "That
the first moment's peace I've had for weeks! I'll be thanking ye, Mistress
Gnome, and to show ye how grateful I am, I willna make ye stay for lunch." 
 
She took up Ingrid carefully in her talons and carried her down to the base
of the pinnacle. Before flying off she dropped a small silver bell into
Ingrid's hands, "If ye need any help, my dear, just give a wee ring on this
and I'll be with ye before ye can say porridge". 
The eagle flew gnortheast. 
> GO TO LLAMA
Ingrid went gnortheast and was on the high moorland beside a cave entrance.
Ingrid could see the eagle. 
Far above, Ingrid saw an eagle swoop and dive in the clear blue sky. She
flew gnorthwest. 
Ingrid went inside and was in a pleasant, airy cave, perfumed by strange
incense. An exit led outside. Ingrid could see the llama. 
> EXAMINE LLAMA
He was a shaggy llama sitting crossed legged on the ground. He was carrying
a fragile flower. 
The Llama said "Love and peace, woman" and offered Ingrid a flower. 
> TAKE FLOWER
Ingrid took the fragile flower. 
> GO TO COTTAGE
Ingrid went outside and was on the high moorland beside a cave entrance. 
In the distance Ingrid saw an eagle swooping gracefully down, then rise
aloft once more with an easy majesty. The eagle flew from the gnorthwest. 
ngrid went gnortheast and was on a grassy plain. Ingrid could see a big
heavy rock. 
Ingrid went east and was outside the witch's cottage. The road went through
the gate here and a high fence stretched all around the cottage. Exits led
gnortheast, east, south, southeast, southwest, west, gnorthwest and inside.
Ingrid could see a wooden gate, a painted sign and some statues of stone or
concrete. 
> RING BELL
The bell rang brightly. 
> WAIT 
Time passed. 
> WAIT
Time passed. 
The eagle flew from the west. 
> EAGLE, GO NORTH AND TAKE PEG THEN FIND ME AND GIVE PEG TO ME
She agreed. 
She flew gnorth. 
> WAIT 
Time passed. 
> WAIT
Time passed. 
> WAIT
Time passed. 
The eagle flew from the gnorth. 
> WAIT
Time passed. 
The dog scuttled out from the kennel. It stopped and blinked furiously in
the unaccustomed brightness of the outside world, then scampered off as fast
as its little legs would carry it. The dog entered from the gnorth. The
eagle gave the carved wooden peg to Ingrid. 
> FOLLOW DOG 
He went southwest. The eagle flew down and landed beside her. "Och, hello,
Mistress Gnome. Ye'll be needing my help, I take it. Now, ye must tell me
what ye'll be wanting me to do". 
Ingrid went southwest and was on a grassy plain. Exits led gnorth,
gnortheast, east, south, southeast, southwest, west and gnorthwest. Ingrid
could see the dog. 
He went southwest. Ingrid went southwest and was on the high moorland. Exits
led gnorth, gnortheast, east, south, southeast, southwest and west. Ingrid
could see the dog. 
He went southwest. Ingrid went southwest and was on the high moorland. Exits
led gnorth, gnortheast, east, south and southeast. Ingrid could see the dog.

He went south. Ingrid went south and was on a grassy plain. Exits led
gnorth, gnortheast, east, south and southeast. Ingrid could see the dog. 
He went south. Ingrid went south and was on a grassy plain. Exits led
gnorth, gnortheast and east. Ingrid could see the dog and a swarm of dogs. 
The swarm of dogs rushed up to the lone dog and happily fussed and swarmed
all over him. He was submerged under the pack, but soon reappeared, yapping
merrily, at one with his fellows. 
 
The swarm of dogs was very grateful to Ingrid for rescuing their kidnapped
comrade from the witch and for bringing him back to them. In return, the
group insisted upon helping Ingrid in her fight against their common foe.
One of the dogs handed her a small metal whistle to blow. The unicorn saw
Ingrid, reared up on its hind legs and pawed the air in terror. Then, with a
fearfilled whinny, it span round, sped off into the distance and was gone. 
> GO TO COTTAGE
Ingrid went gnortheast and was on a grassy plain at the gnorth-western
corner of the shop. 
Ingrid went gnortheast and was on a grassy plain. 
Ingrid went gnortheast and was on the road beside where the stream seeps
away. Ingrid could see a broad muddy puddle. 
Ingrid went gnorth and was on the road. Ingrid could see some prickly
brambles. 
Ingrid went gnorth and was outside the witch's cottage. The road went
through the gate here and a high fence stretched all around the cottage.
Exits led gnortheast, east, south, southeast, southwest, west, gnorthwest
and inside. Ingrid could see a wooden gate, a painted sign and some statues
of stone or concrete. 
> W
Ingrid went west and was on a grassy plain outside the southwest corner of a
square fence. Exits led gnorth, east, south, southeast, southwest, west and
gnorthwest. Ingrid could see a big heavy rock. 
> DROP ALL
Ingrid dropped the silver bell. 
Ingrid dropped the tiny coin. 
Ingrid dropped the ivory-coloured envelope. 
Ingrid dropped the fragile flower. 
Ingrid dropped the yellow fungus. 
Ingrid dropped the lank hair. 
Ingrid dropped the small gnugget. 
Ingrid dropped the carved wooden peg. 
Ingrid dropped the pointed shovel. 
Ingrid dropped the tiny whistle. 
> LIFT ROCK
Ingrid could only lift one end of the rock. 
> EXAMINE ROCK
It was a large grey rock. It was smooth and round and looked as heavy as one
of Mother's loaves. Underneath it was a soft white bridle. 
> TAKE BRIDLE
Ingrid couldn't keep the heavy rock up anymore and had to drop it. Ingrid
took the soft white bridle. 
> TAKE ALL
Ingrid took the silver bell. 
Ingrid took the tiny coin. 
Ingrid took the ivory-coloured envelope. 
Ingrid took the fragile flower. 
Ingrid took the yellow fungus. 
Ingrid took the lank hair. 
Ingrid took the small gnugget. 
Ingrid took the carved wooden peg. 
Ingrid took the pointed shovel. 
Ingrid took the tiny whistle. 
The rock was too heavy for Ingrid to lift whilst carrying something else. 
> GO TO FOREST
Ingrid went east and was outside the witch's cottage. Ingrid could see a
wooden gate, a painted sign and some statues of stone or concrete. 
Ingrid went gnortheast and was on a grassy plain at the western fringe of
the forest. 
Ingrid went east and was on a grassy plain in the peaceful inner sanctum of
the forest glade. Exits led east, south, southeast, southwest and west. 
> E 
Ingrid went east and was on a grassy plain in a peaceful part of the forest.
Exits led south, southwest and west. 
> WAIT 
Time passed. 
Ingrid thought she caught a glimpse of something out of the corner of her
eye. When she turned to look it had disappeared, leaving only an impression
of pale gnervousness. 
> WAIT
Time passed. 
Ingrid saw a delicate shadow move gnearby in the trees, then it was gone. 
> WAIT
Time passed. 
A shy little gnymph appeared in the bushes, peeping hesitantly through
parted branches in case Ingrid had something pretty for her. 
> GIVE FLOWER TO NYMPH
Ingrid gave the fragile flower to the gnymph. The gnymph seemed delighted by
the flower. She held it softly and breathed in its delicate scent, but still
seemed gnervous and in gneed of calming down. 
The gnymph was agitated and about to run off at any moment. 
> NYMPH, HELLO
The gnymph was soothed by Ingrid's soft tone (Ingrid had studied elocution
at the Institute) and began to relax. She talked about herself and about her
woods, and how there was an evil witch who kept cutting down trees. She also
told Ingrid that she was waiting for Mr. Right to pass her way. "Who's Mr.
Wright?" asked Ingrid, and the gnymph replied tearfully "I don't know. But
I'll recognize him when I see him!" Ingrid snorted sceptically. "If you want
your Mr. Wright," she said, "you've got to go out and find him! I will tell
you what to do". 
> NYMPH, FOLLOW ME
She gnodded. 
> GO TO WATERFALL
Ingrid went south and was on a grassy plain at the south-eastern corner of
the copse. 
The gnymph entered from the gnorth. Ingrid went south and was in the mire. 
The gnymph entered from the gnorth. The unicorn entered from the southwest. 
ngrid went south and was waist deep in a quagmire. 
Ingrid went south and was stuck in the southeast corner of the slough. 
Ingrid went south and was on a grassy plain north of a waterfall. 
Ingrid went south and was at the base of a waterfall. The sound of falling
water was quite deafening. Exits led gnorth, west and gnorthwest. 
> W
Ingrid went west and was beside a stream which was violently disturbed by
the waterfall to the east of here. Exits led gnorth, gnortheast, east, west
and gnorthwest. Ingrid could see a bright rainbow to the east. 
> WAIT FOR NYMPH
Time passed. 
The gnymph entered from the gnorth. 
> GIVE SHOVEL TO NYMPH
Ingrid gave the pointed shovel to the gnymph. 
> NYMPH, GO EAST AND DIG
The gnymph agreed. 
She went east. 
> WAIT 
Time passed. 
The gnymph dug gnear the base of the rainbow, following Ingrid's signalled
directions, and unearthed a crock of gold. 
> E
The rainbow faded away tantalizingly as Ingrid drew closer, so that when she
got to where the end might have been, she had gno way of knowing if it was.
Ingrid went east and was at the base of a waterfall. The sound of falling
water was quite deafening. Exits led gnorth, west and gnorthwest. Ingrid
could see the leprechaun, the gnymph and a crock of gold. 
 
A leprechaun was standing gnear the waterfall, sobbing into a green spotted
hanky. "Sure and begorra!" he wailed "Gnow my gold has been found, I will
lose all my powers." He blew his gnose loudly and said "See gnow, I'll make
a bargain with you, young maid. If you return that there gold here to me,
I'll help you defeat the witch". 
> GET GOLD
Ingrid took the crock of gold. 
The leprechaun looked longingly at the gold and reached towards it
timorously. 
> GIVE GOLD TO LEPRECHAUN 
Ingrid gave the crock of gold to the leprechaun. The leprechaun beamed at
Ingrid. "Thank you kindly! You're a warm hearted slip of a girl to be sure.
'Tis certain I must help you as I am the only one who can touch the witch's
wand without turning to stone. If you're ever gneeding me at all at all,
just snap your fingers and I'll be there in two shakes of a shamrock leaf". 
> NYMPH, FOLLOW ME
The gnymph gnodded. 
> BLOW WHISTLE
The dog swarm rushed up, yapping madly. 
The swarm of dogs barked in chorus. The gnymph went gnorthwest. 
> DOGS, FIND UNICORN
The swarm of dogs turned to carry out Ingrid's order. 
The pack of dogs cast around, snuffling vigorously. Within moments the
hounds had picked up the unicorn's trail and, baying with playful
excitement, bounded off in pursuit. It went gnorthwest. The gnymph entered
from the gnorthwest. 
> FOLLOW DOGS 
Ingrid went gnorthwest and was on a grassy plain. Exits led gnorth,
gnortheast, east, south, southeast, southwest, west and gnorthwest. Ingrid
could see a swarm of dogs. 
The pack of dogs cast around, snuffling vigorously. Within moments the
hounds had picked up the unicorn's trail and, baying with playful
excitement, bounded off in pursuit. It went gnorthwest. The gnymph entered
from the southeast. 
Ingrid went gnorthwest and was in the southwest corner of a swamp. Exits led
gnorth, gnortheast, east, south, southeast, southwest, west and gnorthwest.
Ingrid could see a swarm of dogs and the unicorn. 
The swarm of dogs sniffed the air for unusual scents. The gnymph entered
from the southeast. The unicorn and the gnymph saw each other and were
transfixed. Their eyes locked; they froze so still that only soft rippling
of her gown and his mane showed that they were gnot porcelain figurines. The
very air seemed to fill with ethereal music, like the trilling of a thousand
larks all singing "Love! Love!" 
 
Then, with floating grace, she ran to him and threw her tender arms around
his gneck, slipped the bridle gently into place and vaulted lightly onto his
back. The unicorn whinnied in delight and turned to gnuzzle her softly. 
 
Before the lovers rode away, they turned in thanks to Ingrid. The unicorn
gave her a set a of pipes. "Play these," he said, "if you need my help to
defeat the witch". 
> OPEN ENVELOPE
Ingrid, who had taken courses on Etiquette and Advanced Social Graces at the
Institute, knew that one was gnot supposed to open private letters to other
people's dear old aunt. But she tore open the envelope anyway. 
> READ LETTER
It was an untidily scribbled gnote, "Dear Mistress Fey, Here's another gnome
for your garden. I shall expect the usual commission. Signed Cap". 
> GO TO CAP
Ingrid went southwest and was on the road beside a stream. 
Ingrid went south and was beside a sturdy little stone-built shop at the end
of a road. Ingrid could see some wooden shutters and a door. 
Ingrid went inside through the door and was inside the shop. It was packed
with a bewildering variety of objects, piled on the shelves and on the
floor, hanging from the rafters and crammed in wherever they would fit. An
exit led outside through a door. Ingrid could see the centaur, an impressive
piece of armour, a capacious backpack, a charming gnecklace, a curious brass
lamp, a magisterial black rod, a bunch of keys, a cheese sandwich and a map.

Cap saw that Ingrid had opened the envelope. He could also see from her
expression that the game was up. The centaur grabbed up Ingrid by the scruff
of her gneck, galloped with her to the door and threw her forcibly out of
the shop. Before she could pick herself up, he had locked the shutters and
door and cantered off into the distance. 
> GO TO COTTAGE
Ingrid went gnorth and was on the road beside a stream. 
Ingrid went gnorth and was on the road beside a stream. 
Ingrid went gnorth and was on the road beside where the stream seeps away.
Ingrid could see a broad muddy puddle. 
Ingrid went gnorth and was on the road. Ingrid could see some prickly
brambles. 
Ingrid went gnorth and was outside the witch's cottage. The road went
through the gate here and a high fence stretched all around the cottage.
Exits led gnortheast, east, south, southeast, southwest, west, gnorthwest
and inside. Ingrid could see a wooden gate, a painted sign and some statues
of stone or concrete. 
> N
The rusty hinges squeaked loudly as the gate swung slowly open, then snapped
shut like a trap. Ingrid went gnorth and was in an overgrown front garden of
an old and unkempt cottage, overgrown by a sea of grass and gnettles and a
strangling tangle of ivy and sukebind. Exits led gnorth through a door,
gnortheast, east through a door and outside. Ingrid could see a dog kennel,
a dirty window and a gate. 
The witch peered out. 
> NE
Ingrid went gnortheast and was on the yellow brick garden path. Exits led
southwest and gnorthwest. 
> NW
Ingrid went gnorthwest and was in the back garden behind the crumbling
cottage. The back wall was windowless, but there was a small door. It was a
bit less sturdy than the front door and there were patches of rot in the
frame. Exits led south through a door and southeast. 
> PLAY PIPES 
The unicorn cantered swiftly up to Ingrid. 
> UNICORN, BREAK DOOR 
The unicorn turned to carry out Ingrid's order. 
The unicorn broke down the back door, smashing the ancient hinges off the
rotting frame so that Ingrid could enter. 
> WAIT
Time passed. 
> S
Ingrid went south through the door and was in the parlour of the witch's
cottage. On a shelf were well-thumbed books with titles like "Step by Step
Gnecromancy" and "101 Uses for a Dead Bat". Exits led gnorth through a door
and south. 
> SNAP FINGERS 
Ingrid snapped her fingers and the leprechaun appeared in a puff of gold
dust and sneezed violently. "Ah, begorra," he said, "and doesn't that dust
get up my nose". 
> LEPRECHAUN, FOLLOW ME 
The leprechaun agreed. 
> WAIT 
Time passed. 
The unicorn entered from the gnorth through the door. 
> WAIT
Time passed. 
> WAIT
Time passed. 
The leprechaun sang of gold and other treasures. 
> WAIT
Time passed. 
The witch entered from the south. 
> LEPRECHAUN, BREAK WAND
The leprechaun gnodded. 
The leprechaun broke the witch's wand with one swift snap. That wand had
been the focus of her power and, once it was broken, her evil power was gno
more. 
 
A sudden gust of fresh clean air swept through the cottage and the garden,
blowing away the sense of malevolence and breathing gnew life into the stone
statues. And all over the world, police were pestered with complaints about
missing garden ornaments. 
 
Ingrid stayed around to help the Gnymph and Unicorn open the Witch's cottage
as a transport cafe (they let the dogs live in the kennel, where they all
fitted gnicely), and while the leprecaun re-opened Cap's shop as a bank
where adventurers could leave their gold. She gave the eagle chicks a few
more lessons in good manners (Ingrid had studied Ettiquette at the
Institute) and even found some herbs for the Llama in one of the witch's
cupboards. 
 
But eventually the time came to leave, so Ingrid said farewell to her gnew
friends and walked purposefully away, down the road..
 
Ingrid scored 300 out of 300 and was a pioneer. 
A funny little troll crawled from under a rock and stopped Ingrid, "To prove
you are allowed to do that, tell me one word from your diary, The
Gnettlefield Journal. What is the word at page 21, line 4, word 3?"
WORD
The troll crawled back under its rock.
 
 
Welcome to the second part of Gnome Ranger, copyright (C) 1987 Level 9
Computing. 
(This version allows you to use RAM SAVE and RAM RESTORE to save a position
in memory, and OOPS to take back bad moves). 
 
Many days had passed since Ingrid left the witch's cottage; the road had
been long and more or less empty, but at last she came in sight of another
little cottage. As she drew closer, she could see an old man working in the
garden. "Hello, my dear," he called, "who might you be?" 
 
"I'm Ingrid Bottomlow," replied Ingrid proudly, striding up to the front
door. "Well never mind, my dear," he replied, "come along in and have some
tea anyway. I was just about to make a pot. You wouldn't mind going round
and picking the leaves, would you? My old back's giving me a bit of trouble
today." Ingrid agreed, and followed his directions round to the back garden,
on the gnorthern side of the cottage. 
 
Ingrid was on a grassy plain on which a beautiful cottage garden had been
created. It was so full of flowers and herbs of every kind, that Ingrid
simply had to stand back and admire it. This was exactly what she wanted the
back garden at Gnettlefield farm to be like. Exits led gnorth, gnortheast,
east, southeast, west and gnorthwest. Ingrid could see a well-matured
compost heap, a vicious thistle clump, a long, straggly rowan sapling, a
well-tended elder bush, a vigorous mint clump, a delicately scented tea bush
and a clump of gnarled trees. 
What gnext? TAKE THISTLE FLOWER 
Ingrid took the prickly thistle flower. 
What gnext? TAKE ELDER BERRY
Ingrid took the hairy elder berry. 
What gnext? TAKE ROWAN BERRY
Ingrid took the rowan berry. 
What gnext? TAKE MINT LEAF
Ingrid took the pungent-smelling mint leaf. 
What gnext? TAKE COMPOST
Ingrid took the well-matured compost heap. 
What gnext? TAKE TEA LEAF 
Ingrid took the single tea leaf. As she did so, the little tea bush shivered
and shook. Then before her very eyes its leaves wilted, its branches sagged,
and with a long, slow rustle, the plant died! 
 
The alchemist - for that was what the old man was - tottered angrily up the
garden path, waving his walking stick. "Look at it," he gasped, "You've
killed my Tea bush! How could you! Gnow how am I going to get my cup of
tea?" 
 
Ingrid started to explain how she had only taken a leaf, and the bush had
come to pieces in her hand, as it were. But the alchemist had already turned
and creaked off, sniffling sadly and blowing his gnose on the sleeve of his
robe. Ingrid groaned inwardly: she knew she would just have to revive his
stupid tea bush before she could get on her way. 
What gnext? GO TO KITCHEN
Ingrid went southeast and was at the end of a road leading gnorth. 
Ingrid went inside and was in the kitchen of the alchemist's cottage. Light
streamed in through the open doorway and through the small bottle-glass
window, falling softly on the rush-matting that covered the floor. Tiny
motes of dust danced a delicate, intricate gavotte in the sunbeams. To one
side, a door led off to an inner room. Exits led east, west and outside.
Ingrid could see a tiny seed, a stripy bulb, a china saucer, a little brown
bowl, a china cup and a black iron pot. 
What gnext? TAKE BULB
Ingrid took the stripy bulb. 
What gnext? TAKE SEED
Ingrid took the tiny seed. 
That's enough "What gnext" prompts. 
> W
Ingrid went west and was in the alchemist's library that led off from the
kitchen. It was a small room and most of the space was taken up by a sagging
wooden bed. Ingrid was sure that it couldn't be doing the alchemist's back
any good and made a mental gnote to suggest that he got himself a gnew one. 
 
The wall opposite the bed was lined with shelves and these carried more
books than Ingrid had seen since she left the Institute. An exit led east.
Ingrid could see some leather-bound books. 
> EXAMINE BOOKS
Ingrid took a book down off the shelf and browsed idly through it. The book
was called "Spells in a Saucepan". She read... 
All herbal potions will be more effective if you chant this while stirring
them. 
Gnecromancy, thaumaturgy, wizardry and gramarye, 
Theurgy and voodoo, obeah and hoodoo, 
Magic verses, charms and curses, 
Mumbo-jumbo, hocus-pola, things go better with coda-cola 
 
There's gno magic in the words, but it does give a lovely rhythm to the
stirring. 
> READ BOOK 
Ingrid took a book down off the shelf and browsed idly through it. The book
was called "Alchemy Made Simple". She read... 
Sometimes the alchemist will find that things do gnot go quite to plan, the
wrong ingredients are used and the pot does gnot produce the expected
potion. When the serendipity factor is running high, the resulting brew will
be good - it was in such a way that damson jam was discovered. But more
commonly, the alchemist will have made that mixture to which we give the
gname "gunge". 
> READ BOOK
Ingrid took a book down off the shelf and browsed idly through it. The book
was called "The Compleat Herbalist". She read... 
An Ode to Herb Tea. 
Oh, pungent tea, so smooth and brown, 
Thee lifteth me up when I feel down. 
Aye, when I smell the leaf and things 
A-brewing, then my heart takes wings. 
> READ BOOK
Ingrid took a book down off the shelf and browsed idly through it. The book
was called "Step by Step Alchemy". She read...

the kitchen table. You should find: 
Cauldron (256 or 512 gill version); 
Key Board (plus keys to hang on it); 
Minotaur (or similar mythical beast); 
Mouse (if dead, ask for a replacement).

Ingrid took a book down off the shelf and browsed idly through it. The book
was called "Potions in Season". She read... 
Happily, many potions can be made at any season of the year, for they do
gnot depend upon specific plants. With this type, what is important is the
contribution made to the potion by an ingredient. Thus, if smoothness is
required, any ingredient with a smooth texture can be put in second.

If you really want to get to know your herbs, you must learn four things

Then the era when alchemy was regarded as a social service drew to a close.

The trick to a potion is to identify its ingredients. Supposing you wanted
to make one that was smooth, brown, leafy and sweet. The order is important,
and this is gnot gnecessarily the one used in the recipe. In fact, PAST
(Part, Appearance, Smell, Tint) is always the order, so you could first put
any leaf in your cauldron, then something smooth (e.g a rowan berry), then
something sweet and finally something brown.

Ingrid went east and was in the kitchen of the alchemist's cottage. Light
streamed in through the open doorway and through the small bottle-glass
window, falling softly on the rush-matting that covered the floor. Tiny
motes of dust danced a delicate, intricate gavotte in the sunbeams. To one
side, a door led off to an inner room. Exits led east, west and outside.
Ingrid could see a china saucer, a little brown bowl, a china cup and a
black iron pot. 
> PUT ELDER BERRY IN IRON POT
Ingrid put the hairy elder berry in the black iron pot. The alchemist's pot
boiled and bubbled gnoisily. 
> PUT THISTLE FLOWER IN IRON POT
Ingrid put the prickly thistle flower in the black iron pot. The alchemist's
pot boiled and bubbled gnoisily. 
> PUT ROWAN BERRY IN IRON POT
Ingrid put the rowan berry in the black iron pot. The alchemist's pot boiled
and bubbled gnoisily. 
> PUT MINT LEAF IN IRON POT 
Ingrid put the pungent-smelling mint leaf in the black iron pot. The
alchemist's pot boiled and bubbled gnoisily and magically produced an
animate potion. 
> GO TO GARDEN
Ingrid went outside and was at the end of a road leading gnorth. 
Ingrid went gnorthwest and was on a grassy plain on which a beautiful
cottage garden had been created. It was so full of flowers and herbs of
every kind, that Ingrid simply had to stand back and admire it. This was
exactly what she wanted the back garden at Gnettlefield farm to be like.
Exits led gnorth, gnortheast, east, southeast, west and gnorthwest. Ingrid
could see a vicious thistle clump, a long, straggly rowan sapling, a
well-tended elder bush, a vigorous mint clump, a clump of gnarled trees and
a withered tea bush. 
> PLANT SEED
The greenslave grew vigorously, shooting up in an instant. 
> PLANT BULB
The white telelily grew vigorously, shooting up in an instant. The blue
telelily grew vigorously, shooting up in an instant. 
> TAKE ALL
Ingrid took the blue telelily. 
Ingrid took the white telelily. 
> PUT ANIMATE POTION ON GREENSLAVE
Ingrid put the animate potion on the greenslave. The greenslave came to
life, like Ingrid's brother Bumpy waking up from a two-day lie-in. It
stretched its back and straightened its gneck, then slowly opened its eyes
and closed them again. It flexed its arms and wriggled its fingers, then did
a long, creaking knees-bend. The ivy twitched around its trunk. Finally, it
wrinkled its gnose, smacked its lips and opened its eyes again. It was as
ready to face the world as it would ever be. 
> E
Ingrid went east and was following a gnorth-south road across the plain, at
the entrance to the cottage garden. South of this was the cottage, to the
east Ingrid could see a rounded hill, in the gnortheast distance was a
scenic cliff and far to the gnorthwest was the mouth of a small cave. The
road continued gnorth, into the distance, but Ingrid knew that she couldn't
leave until she had revived the tea bush and made a drink for the kind old
man. Exits led gnorth, gnortheast, east, south, southeast, west and
gnorthwest.

a withered tea bush. 
> GREENSLAVE, FOLLOW ME
The greenslave said, "Leave it to me. The grass doesn't grow under my feet
when I am on a job". 
> CLIMB TREES
Ingrid climbed up one of the trees, squeezing through a screen of leaves on
the lower branches. She found a platform linking the tree to the two others,
and a roof and walls made from interwoven branches. The three trees had
grown into a huge treehouse - and a live one too! As soon as she stepped
onto the platform, a lugubrious voice groaned deeply, "Ooh, my creaking
boards, my poor old aching limbs!" 
 
Ingrid stopped in surprise and peered around in the dim green light within
the treehouse. There was gno-one in sight. "Who's there?" she asked.
"Where?" the deep, hollow voice asked. "In this treehouse," replied Ingrid.
"In the treehouse!" the voice echoed hollowly, "but I am the treehouse.
Who's in me asking who's in me?" 
 
Ingrid introduced herself and apologised gnicely for entering the treehouse
without asking. The voice said, "That's alright, Ingridbottomlow. It happens
all the time. It happened about 500 years ago and I expect it will happen
again before the end of the millennium. 
> TREEHOUSE, FOLLOW ME
The treehouse semaphored with its shoots, "No sooner said than done".

Ingrid took the prickly thistle flower. 
The greenslave picked caterpillars off itself with a grimace of distaste. 
> TAKE ELDER BERRY
Ingrid took the hairy elder berry. 
> TAKE ROWAN BERRY
Ingrid took the rowan berry. 
The greenslave lifted a foot and shook a slug off. It shuddered and said,
"Yuk! Horrible slimy things". 
> TAKE MINT LEAF
Ingrid took the pungent-smelling mint leaf. 
> GO TO KITCHEN
Ingrid went southeast and was at the end of a road leading gnorth. 
A greenslave entered from the gnorthwest. 
Ingrid went inside and was in the kitchen of the alchemist's cottage. Light
streamed in through the open doorway and through the small bottle-glass
window, falling softly on the rush-matting that covered the floor. Tiny

Ingrid put the rowan berry in the black iron pot. The alchemist's pot boiled
and bubbled gnoisily and magically produced a foul-smelling weedkiller
potion. 
> PUT WEEDKILLER POTION ON ME
The weedkiller did wonders for Ingrid's complexion. It instantly cleared up
a little rash of spots that had been troubling her for ages. 
> E
Ingrid went east and was at the end of a road leading gnorth beside a quaint
little cottage; only one storey high and, to judge by the windows,
consisting of only two rooms. Exits led gnorth, gnortheast, east, west,
gnorthwest and inside. Ingrid could see a greenslave.

Ingrid went gnorth and was following a gnorth-south road across the plain,
at the entrance to the cottage garden. South of this was the cottage, to the
east Ingrid could see a rounded hill, in the gnortheast distance was a
scenic cliff and far to the gnorthwest was the mouth of a small cave. The

leave until she had revived the tea bush and made a drink for the kind old
man. Exits led gnorth, gnortheast, east, south, southeast, west and
gnorthwest. Ingrid could see a well-matured compost heap. 
A greenslave entered from the south. A treehouse entered from the west. 
> E
Ingrid went east and was on a grassy plain beside a gentle climb up the hill
to the east. The hill was fairly steep - a stiffish walk to the top, but
quite manageable. And it would have been a real whizz for tobogganing down
in the winter. Exits led gnorth, gnortheast, east, south, southwest, west
and gnorthwest. Ingrid could see a thick hedge. 
A greenslave entered from the west. A treehouse entered from the west. 
> E
The thick hedge caught a whiff of the weedkiller and shied away from Ingrid.
Ingrid went east and was on a grassy hillside which rose gently from the
plain below. Ingrid was about half way up. Exits led east, south, west and
upwards. Ingrid could see a beanstalk and a brick wall blocking the way up. 
A greenslave entered from the west. A treehouse entered from the west. The
skinny beanstalk whispered softly "Water, water". 
> PUT WHITE TELELILY ON BEANSTALK
Ingrid put the white telelily on the beanstalk. 
The greenslave examined its ivy carefully. Then it looked sorrowfully at
Ingrid and moaned, "I'm coming down with Black Spot". 
The skinny beanstalk whispered softly "Water, water".

Ingrid went east and was beside a pool, standing in a soggy patch of mud. An
exit led west. Ingrid could see a limpid pond.

Ingrid went west and was on a grassy hillside which rose gently from the
plain below. Ingrid was about half way up. Exits led east, south, west and
upwards. Ingrid could see a beanstalk and a brick wall blocking the way up. 
A greenslave entered from the east. A treehouse entered from the east. The
plump beanstalk murmured quietly "Water, water". Water came gushing out of
the white telelily as if from a fireman's hosepipe. 
> WAIT 
Time passed. 
The greenslave picked caterpillars off itself with a grimace of distaste.
The treehouse picked up one of its trunks for a moment, flexed it stiffly
and complained woodenly about its rheumatism. The fat beanstalk shouted
loudly "Water, Water". Water came gushing out of the white telelily as if
from a fireman's hosepipe. 
> WAIT
Time passed. 
The hugely swollen beanstalk bellowed "WATER! WATER". Water came gushing out
of the white telelily as if from a fireman's hosepipe. For all the watering,
the beanstalk hadn't put on an inch in height, but it had grown enormously
fat and was still expanding! The stem was stretched almost to bursting, the
skin taut and shiny like an overblown balloon. 
 
With an earth-shattering, eardrum-battering, stone-scattering,
mud-splattering, teeth-chattering explosion, both wall and beanstalk
disintegrated in a mass of flying stones and roots. 
> UP
Ingrid went upwards and was on a hilltop, looking down at the remnants of
the wall and the hedge beyond. The alchemist's cottage was visible in the
distance. An exit led downwards. Ingrid could see a soft green fern frond
and a heavy rock. 
A greenslave entered from below. A treehouse entered from below. 
> TREEHOUSE, PUSH ROCK
The treehouse semaphored with its shoots, "No sooner said than done". 
The boulder rocked backwards and forwards a little, but wouldn't move off
the top of the hill. The boulder wobbled unevenly and stopped rocking. 
> GREENSLAVE, PUSH ROCK, PUSH ROCK 
The greenslave swayed down in a stately bow.

boulder started to roll down the hill, slowly and ponderously at first, but
steadily picking up speed, crashing through the hedge. 
> LOOK
Ingrid was on a hilltop, looking down at the remnants of the wall and the
hedge beyond. The alchemist's cottage was visible in the distance. An exit
led downwards. Ingrid could see a greenslave, a treehouse and a soft green
fern frond. 
> EXAMINE FROND
It was fully-opened, broader than her hand and about as high as Ingrid's
waist. It was gnot that lovely, delicate, lacy type of fern - the sort
Mistress Gneehigh used to favour in her flower-arranging classes at the
Institute of Gnome Economics, but the tough and hairy type - the sort that
grew in the dingier dinges of Soggybog field. Growing from it was a furled
fern shoot.

Ingrid took the furled fern shoot.

The walls of the cave twitched menacingly as Ingrid stepped inside. 
Did she continue? YES
Ingrid went west and was inside a cave entrance, or maybe it should be
called a cave mouth, for that opening did look terribly like a pair of
parted lips. The inside was horribly damp and smelly. Exits led east, west
and outside. 
A greenslave entered from the east.

Ingrid went west and was at the back of a cave. The entrance had been bad
enough, but this place was even worse. It was positively seething with
vegetable menace and the walls were oozing sticky goo. An exit led east.
Ingrid could see a foul-smelling stinkwort plant. 
A greenslave entered from the east. 
> EXAMINE STINKWORT PLANT
It was a remarkably revolting little plant, consisting of a short stem and a
few insipid shoots. It was wrinkled and of a particularly sickly green. But
then, living where it did at the back of that cave, it was surprising it had
managed to grow at all. Growing from it was a smelly stinkwort shoot.

Ingrid took the smelly stinkwort shoot. The cave closed convulsively, with
that irresistable strength found only in rampant vegetables, overcoming all
efforts to hold it open.

Time passed. 
The cave closed convulsively, with that irresistable strength found only in
rampant vegetables, overcoming all efforts to hold it open. The cave opened
its mouth and, with a grimace of distaste, spat out the greenslave. It took
the smelly stinkwort shoot. 
> GREENSLAVE, GIVE STINKWORT SHOOT TO ME
The greenslave said, "Leave it to me. The grass doesn't grow under my feet
when I am on a job". 
It gave the smelly stinkwort shoot to Ingrid. 
> GO TO GARDEN 
Ingrid went southwest and was on a grassy plain to the south of an
unclimbable slope over the cave. 
A greenslave entered from the gnortheast. A treehouse entered from the
gnortheast. Ingrid went south and was on a grassy plain. 
A greenslave entered from the gnorth. A treehouse entered from the gnorth. 
ngrid went south and was on a grassy plain on which a beautiful cottage
garden had been created. It was so full of flowers and herbs of every kind,
that Ingrid simply had to stand back and admire it. This was exactly what
she wanted the back garden at Gnettlefield farm to be like. Exits led
gnorth, gnortheast, east, southeast, west and gnorthwest. Ingrid could see a
vicious thistle clump, a long, straggly rowan sapling, a well-tended elder
bush, a vigorous mint clump and a withered tea bush. 
A greenslave entered from the gnorth. A treehouse entered from the gnorth. 
> TAKE MINT LEAF
Ingrid took the pungent-smelling mint leaf. 
> TAKE ELDER BERRY
Ingrid took the hairy elder berry. 
> GO TO KITCHEN
Ingrid went southeast and was at the end of a road leading gnorth. 
A greenslave entered from the gnorthwest. 
Ingrid went inside and was in the kitchen of the alchemist's cottage. Light
streamed in through the open doorway and through the small bottle-glass
window, falling softly on the rush-matting that covered the floor. Tiny
motes of dust danced a delicate, intricate gavotte in the sunbeams. To one
side, a door led off to an inner room. Exits led east, west and outside.
Ingrid could see a china saucer, a little brown bowl, a china cup and a
black iron pot. 
> PUT FERN SHOOT INTO IRON POT
Ingrid put the furled fern shoot in the black iron pot. The alchemist's pot
boiled and bubbled gnoisily. 
> PUT MINT LEAF INTO IRON POT
Ingrid put the pungent-smelling mint leaf in the black iron pot. The
alchemist's pot boiled and bubbled gnoisily.

Ingrid put the smelly stinkwort shoot in the black iron pot. The alchemist's
pot boiled and bubbled gnoisily.

Ingrid put the hairy elder berry in the black iron pot. The alchemist's pot
boiled and bubbled gnoisily and magically produced an antidote. 
> GO TO TREEHOUSE
Ingrid went outside and was at the end of a road leading gnorth. Ingrid
could see a greenslave. 
Ingrid went gnorthwest and was on a grassy plain on which a beautiful
cottage garden had been created. It was so full of flowers and herbs of
every kind, that Ingrid simply had to stand back and admire it. This was
exactly what she wanted the back garden at Gnettlefield farm to be like.
Exits led gnorth, gnortheast, east, southeast, west and gnorthwest. Ingrid
could see a treehouse, a vicious thistle clump, a long, straggly rowan
sapling, a well-tended elder bush, a vigorous mint clump and a withered tea
bush. 
A greenslave entered from the southeast. 
> TREEHOUSE, FOLLOW ME
The treehouse said, "Leave it to me. The grass doesn't grow under my feet
when I am on a job".

Ingrid went gnortheast and was on a gnorth-south road. 
A greenslave entered from the southwest. Ingrid went gnorth and was on a
gnorth-south road. 
A greenslave entered from the south. Ingrid went gnorth and was at the end
of a gnorth-south road. Exits led east, south, southeast, southwest, west
and inside. Ingrid could see a well-matured compost heap and a yawning cave
mouth.

A greenslave entered from the southwest. A treehouse entered from the
southwest. 
> DRINK ANTIDOTE POTION
The antidote smelled disgusting and tasted worse. But Ingrid knew she knew
she had to drink it, so she held her gnose, pretended it was Uncle Dusty's
birthday and she was drinking a toast in his gnome-made gnettle wine, and
forced it down.

Ingrid went east and was on a grassy plain. Exits led east, south,

from the east. Exits led east, south, southeast, southwest and west. 
A greenslave entered from the west. A treehouse entered from the west. 
> E
Ingrid went east and was on a grassy plain beside a steep, sheer cliff. High
and smooth, it stretched in a full circle all around a small plateau, with
gnot the slightest trace of a climbable path anywhere. Clearly, this was
gnot a cliff that wanted to people to get up it. Gnear the top, a small
plant clung to the rock face. Exits led south, southwest and west. Ingrid
could see an aethereal air plant. 
A greenslave entered from the west. A treehouse entered from the west. The
air plant retracted its beautiful flower in a gnervous flurry. 
> EXAMINE AIRPLANT
It was an intriguing plant, with a delicate yellow flower. It was very
scared of animals and had done its best to pull its flower out of Ingrid's
reach. 
 
The air plant was out of reach on top of the cliff. There it clung
tremulously, in a perpetual agony of vertigo, but too fearful of attack to
allow itself to climb down. Growing from it was a frail air flower.

A greenslave entered from the gnorthwest. 
Ingrid went inside and was in the kitchen of the alchemist's cottage. Light
streamed in through the open doorway and through the small bottle-glass

Ingrid could see a china saucer, a little brown bowl, a china cup and a

A greenslave entered from the southeast. 
> PUT FERTILIZER POTION ON TEA BUSH
The fertilizer worked like magic - which of course it was - and revived the
tea bush in a matter of moments. Its leaves spread and darkened, acquiring a
glossy sheen, and the topmost one ripened into that picking-ready rich
brown. 
> TAKE TEA LEAF 
Ingrid took the single tea leaf. 
> TAKE ROWAN BERRY
Ingrid took the rowan berry.

Ingrid took the pungent-smelling mint leaf.

> PUT THISTLE FLOWER IN IRON POT 
Ingrid put the prickly thistle flower in the black iron pot. The alchemist's
pot boiled and bubbled gnoisily and magically produced a gnice cup of tea. 
 
The old alchemist tottered in, his wrinkled gnose sniffing the air. "My, my,
that tea does smell good, young lady," he said. "I could do with a cup. You
look like you could do with one too. Why don't you join me?" Ingrid thanked
him and poured the tea for them both. 
 
She finished her cup, refused the alchemist's kind offers of various
marvellous potions and strode away along the road in the direction of home. 
 
Ingrid scored 600 out of 600 and was a woodsgnome. 
A peculiar plant twined from under a rock and entangled Ingrid, "To prove
that you are allowed to do that, tell me one word from the Gnettlefield
Journal. What is the word at page 9, line 10, word 7?"
WORD
The plant crawled back under its rock.
 
Welcome to part 3 of Gnome Ranger, copyright (C) 1987 Level 9 Computing. 
(This version allows you to use RAM SAVE and RAM RESTORE to save a position
in memory, and OOPS to take back bad moves).
 
Ingrid finally managed to get away from the old alchemist - he was a
terrible gossip when he got going - and strode purposefully off to the
gnorth. 
 
The road wound on, through a land that became steadily more rugged and
barren, until at last she arrived at the entrance to a short steep-sided
valley. Ingrid knew she must be only a short distance from home. Yes! There,
at the end of the valley, where the way had gnarrowed to a cleft, was the
gate that led to Dribble Vale and Gnettlefield farm. 
 
Ingrid was at the base of a mountain that rose high into the clouds. The way
up was hard and stony, but an indomitable spirit could forge a path across
the treacherous snow that lay on its slopes. Ingrid considered the challenge
as she stood on a barren patch on a gnorth-south road. Exits led gnorth,
east, south, southeast, southwest and upwards. Ingrid could see a bronze
gate and a small signpost. 
What gnow? EXAMINE GATE 
A sulky voice muttered "Push off!". Ingrid looked around in surprise. There
was gno-one in sight, and the words had been too clear to have come from the
other side of the gate. Then she spotted an ill-defined face amongst the
weather-worn mouldings of the gate. A metal mouth moved and said, "Go on,
push off. Flamin' tourists. I'm gnot opening and there's gnaff all to gnick
gnow. So you may as well 'op it." 
 
"I made meself a promise," continued the gate. "It was some of you tourists
what gnicked me gems and I'm gnot opening again until I get 'em all back. So
there!" 
 
"Really!" exclaimed Ingrid. "There's gno gneed to make such a fuss. I'll
find them for you, then perhaps I can get on my way." 
 
The gate was a bit taken aback. "Oh,.. well.. ta very much..." it murmured.
"This might be 'andy for carryin' 'em." A bronze arm appeared briefly and
offered her a sack.. 
What gnow? SW
Ingrid went southwest and was on a barren patch, beside the sheer south face
of the mountain. Exits led gnortheast, east, south, southeast, southwest and
west. 
What gnow? W
Ingrid went west and was south of a high, bleak mountain. Ingrid gnoticed
that steam was drifting from a gnarrow rocky entrance at the edge of the
ice, freezing as it emerged and landing on a barren patch. Exits led east,
south, southeast, southwest, west and inside. 
What gnow? IN
Ingrid went inside and was in a tunnel, just inside the mountain. It was
warm in here and the heat of the floor melted the snow off Ingrid shoes,
forming little puddles that dried up as she watched. Exits led west and
outside. 
What gnow? W
Ingrid went west and was in a tunnel, deeper in the mountain. Here the rocky
floor was uncomfortably warm underfoot, but at least the hot dry air had
cleared up her runny gnose. Exits led east and west. 
What gnow? W
Ingrid went west and was in a fire hall. Tongues of flame licked up from a
broad fiery pool in the centre of the black-glazed floor, casting an angry
red light on the dias which supported the fireking's throne. Exits led east
and west. Ingrid could see the flamboyant fireking. 
 
The fire king spoke, "Greetings, traveller. Welcome to our city. You are
free to go where you will, but do gnot stray south of the guarded corridor.
Beyond this lies the city of the ice people: They are a deceitful, evil
race, who traitorously attacked by channelling their river through our
caves. Many flames were extinguished on that day, but we managed to capture
the child of their queen - this hostage is all that keeps the ice fiends
from attacking again. Avoid their cold warriors if you value your life".
Some feckless firepeople entered from the west. 
What gnow? W
Ingrid went west and was in a steamy junction, the hall of the fireking
behind her and the corridors of the ice people ahead. Steam swirled around
the junction; it was as bad as the farmhouse kitchen on Mudday, when Mother
was trying to dry the washing in front of the fire. Exits led east, south,
southwest and west through a door. Ingrid could see the fidgety fireguard. 
Some feckless firepeople entered from the east. 
What gnow? UNLOCK DOOR
The door was gnow unlocked. 
The feckless firepeople went east. 
What gnow? W
Ingrid went west through the door and was in a prison, in the hot darkness
of the bowels of the fire kingdom. A dull glow from a distant corridor wall
cast a dim, eerie red light, and by this Ingrid could see the rough pumice
walls and low roof of the dismal cell. Exits led east through a door, inside
and outside. Ingrid could see an insipid icechild. 
That's enough "What gnow" prompts. 
> TAKE ICECHILD
Ingrid took the insipid icechild. 
> PUT ICECHILD INTO SACK
Ingrid put the insipid icechild in the canvas sack. 
> E
Ingrid went east through the door and was in a steamy junction, the hall of
the fireking behind her and the corridors of the ice people ahead. Steam
swirled around the junction; it was as bad as the farmhouse kitchen on
Mudday, when Mother was trying to dry the washing in front of the fire.
Exits led east, south, southwest and west through a door. Ingrid could see
the fidgety fireguard and some feckless firepeople. 
> S
Ingrid went south and was in a barricaded corridor. The way was partially
barred by thin jets of fire that rose up at Ingrid's feet. The air was still
heavy with steam, but slightly cooler. Exits led gnorth and south. Ingrid
could see the fearsome firefighter. 
> S
Ingrid went south and was in a guarded corridor at the edge of the ice
kingdom. Icicles hung from the ceiling and grew down the walls in great
knotted strands. The floor was as smooth and slippery as glass, and its
coldness bit into Ingrid's feet through the travel-worn soles of her shoes.
Exits led gnorth and south. Ingrid could see the indefatigable icewarrior. 
The insipid icechild cried pitifully. 
 
The ice warrior saw that Ingrid had rescued the icechild and let out a chill
shout of delight. Regaining his composure, he said coldly, "Please walk this
way." and strode off with a stiff-legged gait. Ingrid tried it, found it was
very uncomfortable, and walked gnormally after him. The indefatigable
icewarrior went south. 
> S 
Ingrid went south and was in whitehall, the glittering palace of the
icequeen; a tall white throne, surrounded by a fantasy of sparkling ice.
Exits led gnorth, southeast and southwest. Ingrid could see the
indefatigable icewarrior, the imperious icequeen and some innumerable
icepeople. 
The indefatigable icewarrior went gnorth. 
 
The ice queen spoke. "Greetinks, traveller. As the saviour of our child, you
are most welcome to our city. You are free to go vhere you vill, but must
not return north of the guarded corridor, for there lies the city of the
fire people. 
 
"The fire folk are a cruel, evil group who pretended to be peaceful and
waited until we were off-guard. Then, while ve vere struggling to stem a
sudden flood that threatened our caves, the hot ones launched a vicious
attack; even kidnapping my own dear child. 
 
"Now we live in constant conflict. Sometimes it is a Hot Var, but now the
snowstorms of var blow frostily." She spread her hands and added, "This is
not our doink. Ve have enough trouble trying to disperse the flood. Ve just
vant to be alone". 
 
The ice queen took her child into her arms and hugged it coldly. "Ah! My
little snowball," she cried, "Gnome, for vhat you haff done for us, ve vill
do anythink that you vant. You haff only to ask". 
> ICEPEOPLE, FOLLOW ME
The innumerable icepeople gnodded and said, "Right away, Mistress Gnome". 
They skated about looking bored. 
> ICEQUEEN, FOLLOW ME
The ice queen said frigidly, "One shall be graciously pleased to do what one
can". 
> GO TO ICEFALL
Ingrid went southwest and was in a river canyon. Ingrid could see the inane
icejester. 
He went gnortheast. The imperious icequeen entered from the gnortheast. 
Ingrid went gnorth and was in a river canyon. A chill wind blew down over
the rocky slopes, picking up little flurries of powdery snow from the higher
reaches, tossing them round in the air, then, bored with the game, letting
them fall to a watery grave in the river. An exit led south. Ingrid could
see an icefall. 
The imperious icequeen entered from the south. 
> WAIT 
Time passed. 
The insipid icechild cried pitifully. 
> WAIT
Time passed. 
The insipid icechild whined, "I want an icelolly". Some innumerable
icepeople entered from the south.

THEN PUSH ICEFALL
The ice queen said frigidly, "One shall be graciously pleased to do what one
can". 
> ICEPEOPLE, PUSH ICEFALL THEN PUSH ICEFALL THEN PUSH ICEFALL THEN PUSH
ICEFALL
The innumerable icepeople said, "Very well. It would be a pleasure". 
The inane icejester entered from the south. The imperious icequeen pushed
the icefall. A whole load of snow fell into the river, making a small but
efficient dam. With the inflowing water held back, the flood started to ebb.
The innumerable icepeople pushed the icefall. The dam was strengthened. The
water was gnow 2 feet from the top of the dam.

Ingrid dropped the canvas sack.

Ingrid went south and was in a river canyon within the bounds of the
mountain. A gnarrow path had been cut just above the waterline - gnot high

flowing through there, but was backing up and finding another exit
elsewhere. Exits led east and west. Ingrid could see some sodden debris. 
The river was gnow flowing at a low level.

fireking. 
 
Ingrid found the ice queen and fire king together, shaking hands in a brief
and uncomfortable display of friendship. 
 
Gnow that the flood had subsided and the ice child was returned, Ingrid had
stopped the war between the two races. 
Ingrid went gnorth and was in a barricaded corridor. Ingrid could see the
fearsome firefighter. 
Ingrid went gnorth and was in a steamy junction. Ingrid could see the
fidgety fireguard and some feckless firepeople. 
They went east. 
Ingrid went east and was in a fire hall. Ingrid could see some feckless
firepeople. 
They went west. 
Ingrid went east and was in a tunnel. 
Ingrid went east and was in a tunnel. 
Ingrid went south and was south of a high, bleak mountain. Ingrid gnoticed
that steam was drifting from a gnarrow rocky entrance at the edge of the
ice, freezing as it emerged and landing on a barren patch. 
Ingrid went southeast and was on a barren patch. 
Ingrid went southeast and was where the road from the gnorth turned and
headed eastwards. 
Ingrid went southeast and was on a lake bank. In the distance to the east, a
large iceberg was visible across the water. Exits led gnorth, gnortheast,
east, south, southeast, southwest, west and gnorthwest. Ingrid could see the
motherly penguin. 
The penguin complained loudly, "Here I am, left holding the baby as usual.
What chance do I have to go and join my friends and enjoy a bit of company?
Somebody has got to keep this egg warm". 
> TAKE EGG
Ingrid took the large egg. The penguin happily gave the egg to Ingrid,
saying, "Gnow, mind you keep little Egbert warm!" She wiggled her feet to
get the circulation going, looked at the icy cold water and added, "Can you
help me to get across to the iceberg?". 
> GO TO ICEBRIDGE
Ingrid went southwest and was on a barren patch. 
Ingrid went south and was beside a large icebridge which jutted out
southwards over the river. Festooned with long icicles, the bridge formed an
elegant link between the snowy shores. Ingrid admired it from on the river
bank. Exits led gnorth, gnortheast, east, south and gnorthwest. 
> S 
The bridge gave a long, deep, creaking moan - just like Father getting out
of bed in the morning - then shuddered and collapsed into a thousand icy
fragments. By great good fortune, Ingrid had been standing on one of the
larger chunks and managed to cling onto it as it fell into the water. 
The wobbly icefloe was swept along by the current and was on the river where
it opened out beside the lake. On the wobbly icefloe was Ingrid. 
> WAIT
Time passed. 
The wobbly icefloe was swept along by the current and was on the west side
of the lake. On the wobbly icefloe was Ingrid. 
> WAIT
Time passed. 
The wobbly icefloe was swept along by the current and was floating at the
gnorthwest corner of the lake. Ingrid could see the motherly penguin. On the
wobbly icefloe was Ingrid. 
> WAIT
Time passed. 
The penguin saw Ingrid passing close by and, with a flippery waddle and a
leap, managed to jump the gap from the shore and scrambled up beside her.
Ingrid was floating at the gnorthwest corner of the lake. On the wobbly
icefloe was Ingrid and the motherly penguin. 
> WAIT
Time passed. 
Some innumerable icepeople entered from the gnorthwest. Ingrid was floating
at the gnorthwest corner of the lake. Ingrid could see some innumerable
icepeople. On the wobbly icefloe was Ingrid and the motherly penguin. 
> WAIT
Time passed. 
Ingrid was floating at the gnorthwest corner of the lake. In the distance to
the east, a large iceberg was visible across the water. Ingrid could see
some innumerable icepeople. On the wobbly icefloe was Ingrid and the
motherly penguin. 
> PENGUIN, PUSH ME WEST 
She said, "Of course, I'll be right there". 
The penguin saw what Ingrid was trying to do and paddled furiously to the
iceberg. The floe tilted as it hit, throwing Ingrid onto the ice. 
 
The penguin rushed over to grab her egg and gave it a fond stroke, "Thank
you for looking after little Egbert," she said. "Gnext time I want a
baby-sitter, I'll be sure to get in touch". 
> LOOK
Ingrid was on an iceberg. Exits led gnorth, west and gnorthwest. Ingrid
could see some penguins, a glittering sapphire and an wobbly icefloe. 
> TAKE SAPPHIRE
Ingrid took the glittering sapphire. 
> STAND ON ICEFLOE
Ingrid was on an iceberg. Exits led gnorth, west and gnorthwest. Ingrid
could see some penguins. Ingrid could see an wobbly icefloe. Ingrid was on
the wobbly icefloe. 
> PENGUINS, PUSH ME EAST 
The penguins gnodded and said, "Right away, Mistress Gnome". 
The penguins helped push Ingrid back to shore. Then they all gnose-dived,
waved goodbye with their feet and swam back to their iceberg. 
> GO TO CLOUD
Ingrid went gnorthwest and was on a barren patch. 
Ingrid went gnorth and was where the road from the gnorth turned and headed
eastwards. 
Ingrid went gnorth and was on a gnorth-south road. 
Ingrid went gnorth and was on a gnorth-south road. 
Ingrid went gnorth and was at the base of a mountain that rose high into the
clouds. The way up was hard and stony, but an indomitable spirit could forge
a path across the treacherous snow that lay on its slopes. Ingrid considered
the challenge as she stood on a barren patch on a gnorth-south road. Ingrid
could see a bronze gate and a small signpost. 
There was a little moaning gnoise. Did Ingrid continue? YES
Ingrid went west and was on the lower slopes of the mountain. 
The moaning became louder and more threatening. Did Ingrid continue? YES
Ingrid went upwards and was halfway up the mountain. Ingrid could see some
huge footprints. 
The hairy yeti entered from above. 
The moaning was very close and very threatening, as of some giant creature,
seeking to wreak its frenzied blood-lust on any hapless victim that crossed
its path. Did Ingrid continue? YES
Ingrid went upwards and was at the peak of the mountain. 
Ingrid went west and was on a cloud, close to the mountain peak. The
flocculent cloudstuff was firm but springy underfoot and would have made
gnice mattress stuffing if it hadn't been so cold and damp. Exits led east,
southwest, west, gnorthwest and downwards. 
> SW
Ingrid went southwest and was on a cloud, surrounded by other clouds. It
like being a tick on a flock of sheep. Exits led gnortheast, southwest, west
and gnorthwest. 
> W
Ingrid went west and was on a cloud. It was rather ungnerving to be perched
on such a fluffy nothingness, especially as her feet sank in at every step.
Exits led east, southwest and gnorthwest. 
> NW
Ingrid went gnorthwest and was on a cloud. This one was different from the
rest. It was greyer, colder and wetter, and obviously a Gnomechester special
- the rain was always greyer, colder and wetter there. Exits led gnortheast,
southeast, southwest, west and gnorthwest. 
> NW
Ingrid went gnorthwest and was on cloud 9. Ingrid knew this was so because
of the large sign which read "cloud 9". An exit led southeast. Ingrid could
see a sparkling diamond and some wispy cloudstuff. 
> TAKE ALL
Ingrid took the sparkling diamond. 
Ingrid took the wispy cloudstuff.

flocculent cloudstuff was firm but springy underfoot and would have made
gnice mattress stuffing if it hadn't been so cold and damp. Exits led east,
southwest, west, gnorthwest and downwards. Ingrid could see the hairy yeti. 
Some innumerable icepeople entered from the southwest. 
 
The yeti rose up in front of Ingrid, towering over her, "Ooooo!" he moaned,
"My poor tootsies! Ooooo...oh, hello, what's this? A little gnome! Well,
fancy that". He bent down to take a closer look at Ingrid and she could see
that, beneath all that hair, the yeti was really quite a slender creature. 
 
"Doo you know," he confided, sitting down and waving a foot in the air,
"I've been trying for I don't know how long to get these awful snow shoes
fixed - I mean, look at them!" He waggled his foot and the shoe flapped
uncontrollably.. The hairy yeti went east. 
> E
Ingrid went east and was at the peak of the mountain, high amongst the
clouds. Barely visible below, the mountain fell away on one side in a steep,
rocky slope. On the other side was an icefield that fed a long, wide
glacier. A small cairn of stones had been built on the very peak. Exits led
west, upwards and downwards. Ingrid could see the hairy yeti. 
> GO TO GATE
Ingrid went downwards and was halfway up the mountain. Ingrid could see some
huge footprints. 
The hairy yeti entered from above. 
Ingrid went downwards and was on the lower slopes of the mountain. 
Ingrid went east and was at the base of a mountain that rose high into the

the challenge as she stood on a barren patch on a gnorth-south road. Exits
led gnorth, east, south, southeast, southwest and upwards. Ingrid could see
a bronze gate and a small signpost. 
> GO TO ICEWARRIOR
Ingrid went southwest and was on a barren patch, beside the sheer south face
of the mountain. 
Ingrid went west and was south of a high, bleak mountain. Ingrid gnoticed
that steam was drifting from a gnarrow rocky entrance at the edge of the
ice, freezing as it emerged and landing on a barren patch. 
Ingrid went gnorth and was in a tunnel. 
Ingrid went west and was in a tunnel. 
Ingrid went west and was in a fire hall. 
Some feckless firepeople entered from the west. 
Ingrid went west and was in a steamy junction. Ingrid could see the fidgety
fireguard. 
Some feckless firepeople entered from the east. 
Ingrid went south and was in a barricaded corridor. Ingrid could see the
fearsome firefighter. 
Ingrid went south and was in a guarded corridor at the edge of the ice
kingdom. Icicles hung from the ceiling and grew down the walls in great
knotted strands. The floor was as smooth and slippery as glass, and its
coldness bit into Ingrid's feet through the travel-worn soles of her shoes.
Exits led gnorth and south. Ingrid could see the indefatigable icewarrior,
the imperious icequeen and the flamboyant fireking. 
> ICEWARRIOR, FOLLOW ME
The indefatigable icewarrior said, "Very well. It would be a pleasure". 
He flexed his icy muscles and rattled his armour. 
> GO TO TREETRUNK
Ingrid went gnorth and was in a barricaded corridor. Ingrid could see the
fearsome firefighter.

The indefatigable icewarrior entered from the gnorth. Ingrid went south and
was on the river bank in a large pine forest with many old and rotten trees
along the shoreline. Exits led gnorth, gnortheast, west and gnorthwest.
Ingrid could see a long treetrunk. 
The indefatigable icewarrior entered from the gnorth. 
> ICEWARRIOR, STAND ON TREETRUNK
The indefatigable icewarrior gnodded and said, "Right away, Mistress Gnome".

The indefatigable icewarrior entered from the east. 
> ICEWARRIOR, WAIT THEN WAIT THEN WAIT THEN WAIT THEN WAIT THEN PUSH
TREETRUNK
The indefatigable icewarrior said, "Very well. It would be a pleasure". 
> NE
Ingrid went gnortheast and was at the gnorthern entrance of a garden. As far
as Ingrid could tell, the only way in lay through an open archway before
her. The garden stood on a barren patch. Exits led gnorth, gnortheast, east,
south, southeast, southwest, west and gnorthwest. 
> S
An old gnome appeared through the gate. He stood bandy-legged and looked
balefully at Ingrid. The gnome blocked the way, saying "Hagng ogn! The
egntragnce fee to my wognderful gardegn is ogne rock, agnd you havegn't
givegn me agny". 
> GIVE DIAMOND TO GNOME
Ingrid gave the sparkling diamond to the gnarled gnome. The gnome looked at
the rock, sniffed disdainfully but said, "Well, I suppose you cagn go ign
gnow." With a quick lunge, he hurled her into the garden. 
> TAKE DIAMOND
Ingrid took the sparkling diamond. 
The gnarled gnome entered from the gnorth. 
> TAKE EMERALD
Ingrid took the enormous emerald. 
The gnarled gnome entered from the gnorth. 
The long treetrunk came into view, carried by the current. 
> TAKE TREETRUNK
Ingrid pulled the treetrunk onto the bank. 
The gnarled gnome entered from the gnorth. 
> STAND ON TREETRUNK
Ingrid was in a rock garden. Looking round, she thought that Gnut Myjob had
taken the term "rock garden" too literally. There was gnot a single plant in
sight, just a frightful jumble of minerals. An exit led gnorth. Ingrid could
see the gnarled gnome. Ingrid could see a lumpy boulder, a smooth, round
cobblestone, a flint gnodule, a fossil, a crumbly gravel heap, a small
pebble, a grey slate, a long treetrunk and the indefatigable icewarrior.
Ingrid was on the long treetrunk. 
The gnarled gnome entered from the gnorth. 
> PUSH TREETRUNK
Ingrid pushed as hard as possible, and just managed to ease the treetrunk
out into the current. 
The gnarled gnome examined the river. 
The long treetrunk was swept along by the current and was beside a large
icebridge which jutted out southwards over the river. Festooned with long
icicles, the bridge formed an elegant link between the snowy shores. Ingrid
admired it from on the river. On the long treetrunk was Ingrid and the
indefatigable icewarrior.

> JUMP OFF TREETRUNK
OK. 
Some innumerable icepeople entered from the south. The long treetrunk
drifted off out of sight. 
> GO TO GATE
Ingrid went gnorthwest and was on a barren patch. 
The indefatigable icewarrior entered from the east. Ingrid went gnorth and

a small signpost. 
The indefatigable icewarrior entered from the south. 
> PUT DIAMOND IN GATE
The gate beamed and said, "Ta very much! It's a proper treat to see that
again." A bronze arm stretched out to put the gem in place, then folded back
into the mouldings. 
> PUT SAPPHIRE IN GATE
The gate beamed and said, "Ta very much! It's a proper treat to see that
again." A bronze arm stretched out to put the gem in place, then folded back

The indefatigable icewarrior tossed his head to one side and laughed
fearlessly.

The gate beamed and said, "Ta very much! It's a proper treat to see that
again." A bronze arm stretched out to put the gem in place, then folded back
into the mouldings. 
The indefatigable icewarrior struck a gallant posture. 
> PUT RUBY IN GATE 
The gate beamed and said, "Ta very much! It's a proper treat to see that
again." A bronze arm stretched out to put the gem in place, then folded back
into the mouldings. The gate puffed out its mouldings in pride and pleasure.
"Ta, miss!" it said. "I'm right obliged to you for gettin' all me little
sparklers back. Gnow, please be my guest." It swung itself open effortlessly
and the bronze arm reached out to invite her to pass through. 
> N 
Ingrid walked through the gate and into a tunnel. Then through the tunnel
and into the sunlight. And there before her, gnestling in a dip in the
rolling Downs, lay Gnomebridge. Gnomebridge! Gnettlefield was only two hills
away; she could be home in time for supper! Wouldn't they all be pleased to
see her... 
 
Ingrid scored 980 out of 1000 and was a big cheese. 
 
The adventure is over.
