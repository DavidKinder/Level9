After your rescue of the Snowball 9 starship, you were astonished to learn
that fire-damaged videos from the control centre seemed to show you as the
saboteur. Unjustly sentenced for hijacking, you managed to steal a
stratoglider to escape and, after a brief flight, have crash-landed on Eden.
(This version allows you to use RAM SAVE and RAM RESTORE to save a position
in memory, and OOPS to "take back" bad moves).
You are in the control room of a crashed stratoglider. A vision screen shows
the strange plants on Eden. There's an opening behind you.
