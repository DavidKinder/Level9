YES
 
Lancelot was riding east along on a forest road. Leafy branches hung over
the track, which was deep rutted and churned by heavy ox carts and the
footprints of men and horses. This was the road to the great city of
Camelot, the heart of the kingdom. 
Thy command, Sire? RESTART
Really restart? YES

YES
 
Lancelot was riding east along on a forest road. Leafy branches hung over
the track, which was deep rutted and churned by heavy ox carts and the
footprints of men and horses. This was the road to the great city of
Camelot, the heart of the kingdom. 
Thy command, Sire? E 
Squire Lancelot rode east and was wading through a ford. Though the river
was wide, it ran swiftly here. Lancelot could see the Black Knight. 
 
The Black Knight sat straight and proud upon his horse and challenged
Lancelot, "Squire, no man can pass this way save with my permission. You
must prove your worth before you may cross this ford". 
Thy command, Sire? ATTACK KNIGHT
They fought for a long time, with neither man giving any quarter. First one
had the upper hand, then the other, and each soon came to know that his
opponent was a valiant knight. They fought on, trading blow for blow, until
at last the Black Knight yielded. Did Lancelot accept his surrender? YES
 
The Black Knight removed his helm and showed himself to be King Arthur.
"Gramercy, sir, you fought well and chivalrously. In truth you were a most
worthy opponent," he said with a bow. "It would please me to knight you and
to have you join the company at the Round Table. Come to me tomorrow, at my
castle in Camelot". 
The king summoned his guards from the bushes beyond, where they had waited
to watch the fight, and the royal party rode for the city. 
Thy command, Sire? E
Squire Lancelot rode east and was on a road lined with great elms. Between
their branches he could see peasants at work on the land. To the east was
the great city of Camelot. Its pale walls reflected the colours of the
setting sun, and seemed to grow in majesty each time he looked up. Lancelot
spurred on his mount, eager to reach his goal with all speed. 
Thy command, Sire? E
Squire Lancelot rode east and was on the road through the castle village.
Untidy mud and straw huts dotted the roadside. Lancelot could see some
peasants and a pot of stew. Children playing in the dirt, and peasant women
scrubbing vegetables outside the huts, stopped to stare silently at Lancelot
as he rode by. But Lancelot scarce noticed the serfs nor their hovels, for
his eyes were fixed upon the walls and towers of Camelot that filled the sky
before him. 
Thy command, Sire? E
Squire Lancelot rode east and was outside the Serfs' Gate. A muddy track led
through the narrow opening, and the hubbub of voices could be heard from
beyond. The double gates were of thick oak, and no larger than need be to
admit a straw wagon or a mounted knight. Lancelot could see a beggar. Dusk
began to suck the colours from the greying world, leaving only the pools of
light from the torches of Camelot. 
Thy command, Sire? E
Squire Lancelot alit from his horse and walked east and was inside the
Serfs' Gate. Piles of rubbish littered the ground, while soldiers and
servant lads scurried to and fro. A few mangy dogs and cats searched among
the debris for scraps of food. Lancelot could see Sir Kay. Two young urchins
turned to stare at squire Lancelot, then ran off to spread word of the new
arrival. 
 
Sir Kay stared full at the newcomer. "Well I never! See what the cat dragged
in. If you have business in this place, I suggest you go and sleep in the
mews. They cost nothing, which should suit you fine, and are close by here".
He gestured arrogantly to the east and north, "Be off with you, squire.
There is a curfew for the rabble, you know". 
Thy command, Sire? GO TO MERLIN
Squire Lancelot went east, mounting his horse and was on the west way.
Narrow, crooked lanes splayed out into the depths of the city. Lancelot
could see a town crier. Shopkeepers hawked their wares, shouting loudly to
all who passed. Lancelot looked on with interest, but did not dally. 
Squire Lancelot rode north and was in the north warren, among the twisting
lanes of the city. As Lancelot rode, the skies darkened to black and rain
started to fall. 
Lancelot was all but struck by peelings thrown from a high window. Lancelot
rode north and was on the road outside the mews. Lancelot realised that this
was the place Kay had named. 
Squire Lancelot rode west and was on the road. Just to the west the paved
surface gave way to a mud track. A stable boy came forth, carrying a
pitchfork full of steaming straw. Lancelot halted his mount to let him pass
by, and the boy grunted his thanks. 
Squire Lancelot rode west and was on the road. Parts of it were very muddy,
and he had to ride in twists and turns to avoid the puddles. As Lancelot
came by, there was a loud barking and baying. 
Squire Lancelot rode west and was on the road, where it dwindled to an end.
At first it seemed as if none lived within, for cobwebs blocked the windows
and the low door hung awry. Against the wall grew a stone coloured host of
GIANT plants, the like of which Lancelot had never seen.
 
A wrinkled hand, enwrapped in a long flapping sleeve, beckoned to him from
an attic window. 
Squire Lancelot alit from his horse and walked north and was on a flight of
ill-lit stairs. The smells of old parchment, herbs and GRASSY substances
drifted down from above.
 
(You will have noticed that some of the words in this game are in capital
letters, e.g "GRASSY" above. These are nothing to do with solving the game
itself, but are clues to a prize competition run in late 1988. From March
1989 onwards, Level 9's cluesheets include details of the contest questions,
a full solution, and how the whole thing went).
 
Squire Lancelot went north and was in the study; almost a CIRCLE in shape,
with tons of wood panelling and doorways to north and east. Skins and heads
of animals hung from the walls, and curiously fashioned devices of wood and
brass stood upon the table and the floor. Lancelot could see Merlin. The sun
streamed through the window, and set a rainbow gleaming from a great glass
jar. 
Merlin said, "Greetings, Lancelot. Your coming was foretold to me in a
dream". 
Thy command, Sire? MERLIN, GREETINGS
Merlin asked Lancelot if he was in good health. 
Merlin said, "Well I never. You look in need of rest and lodgings for the
night. Prithee make yourself at home here". 
Thy command, Sire? N
Squire Lancelot went north and was in the guest room. It was dimly lit and
not at all clean. The room was crammed with things great and small that
Merlin had accumulated and then put aside over many long years. Lancelot
could see a bed. It was nearly buried beneath unpaid bills but, after much
rummaging and tidying, Lancelot at length cleared enough space for himself. 
Merlin entered from the south. Squire Lancelot lay down on the bed. 
To save time, I'll change to ">" prompts. 
> SLEEP
Squire Lancelot lay himself down and made what comfort he could, ready for
sleep. 
Merlin said to Lancelot, "I have something of import to tell you. Know you
well that it is destined that the Queen will come to matter much to you. Her
fate and yours are bound together". Squire Lancelot was full comfortable on
the bed. 
> SLEEP
Squire Lancelot lay himself down and made what comfort he could, ready for
sleep. 
Merlin went south. Squire Lancelot soon descended into sleep. In the
morning, he woke refreshed and ready for the challenges of the new day.

brass stood upon the table and the floor. Lancelot could see Merlin. 
Merlin went east. 
> E
Squire Lancelot went east and was in Merlin's library. It contained more
books than there were stones on the HEATH. Some leant drunkenly against each
other on shelves, others lay on a large desk, amidst a jumble of papers.
Lancelot could see Merlin and some books. Lancelot knocked a phial as he
passed. There was a loud "pop", and a thick cloud of purple smoke burst out
into the room. 
Merlin said to Lancelot, "You will not show yourself to be a noble and
valiant knight here in Camelot". He learned his quality would be weighed,
for ounces or tons, by his actions in the lands beyond, be they large or
MICRO.

Squire Lancelot picked a two pound book at random and read "a selection of
Tristram of Cornwall's WELL-KNOWN compositions for the harp". 
Merlin went west.

> GO TO ARTHUR
Merlin entered from the west. 
Squire Lancelot went west and was in the study; almost a CIRCLE in shape,
with tons of wood panelling and doorways to north and east. 
Squire Lancelot went south and was on a flight of ill-lit stairs. 
Squire Lancelot went south, mounting his horse and was on the road, where it
dwindled to an end. 
Squire Lancelot rode east and was on the road. Parts of it were very muddy,
and he had to ride in twists and turns to avoid the puddles. 
Squire Lancelot rode east and was on the road. Just to the west the paved
surface gave way to a mud track. 
Squire Lancelot rode east and was on the road outside the mews. 
Squire Lancelot rode southeast and was on the north way, that ran between
the warrens and the royal castle wall. Lancelot could see a town crier. A
pilgrim turned his eyes to the south for a last sight of the cathedral
before he set out upon his journey. 
Squire Lancelot rode south and was on the market square, where Lancelot had
to wind his way between makeshift stalls and animal pens. A sorrowfully thin
old woman lurched towards Lancelot, hands outstretched, begging him for
food, but walked away as he showed her that he had none to give. 
Squire Lancelot rode east and was on the lawns beside Arthur's castle. As
Lancelot looked about, he was minded of the formal gardens of his native
France, and did think fondly of home. 
Squire Lancelot alit from his horse and walked north through the door and
was in the great hall of the Round Table. Lancelot could see some sieges and
a Round Table. 
Lancelot stood and gazed about him. This was his first sight of the Round
Table, and he longed to join its chivalrous company. 
Squire Lancelot went north and was in Arthur's echoing hall. Hundreds of
wall torches gave a flickering gold glow to the room, making it seem
welcoming despite its size. Lancelot could see Guenever and King Arthur. 
A company of guards were quick to do their duty, springing forward TO seize
the newcomer, but the young king recognised him and stepped forward in
greeting. 
> ARTHUR, GREETINGS
King Arthur murmured politely. 
Guenever pushed a wisp of hair back into place. King Arthur said, "Welcome
to Camelot, Lancelot. Merlin has foretold that you are fated to become the
greatest of all knights. We are honoured to have you at our court". 
> WAIT
Time passed. 
Guenever smiled at Lancelot. King Arthur said, "I was much taken with your
deeds at our meeting at the ford. You fought with great valour". 
> WAIT
Time passed. 
King Arthur added musingly, "Of course, I was pleased that you did not kill
me. Else there had been all sorts of trouble". 
> WAIT
Time passed. 
Guenever pursed her lips in thought. King Arthur knighted Lancelot, and bade
him stay and dine with them. As they sat at table and the drinks flowed,
Lancelot stole many a glance at Queen Guenever. Truly, he thought, she was a
most beautiful and stately woman. And as the evening wore on, it came to him
that he was fast losing his heart to her. 
At times, their eyes met and Guenever did look away coyly, like a maiden. At
length, with his heart in his mouth, he essayed to beg of her the favour of
being her champion. As he had feared, she refused for that she should not be
championed by a novice, and for a dreadful moment Lancelot thought she would
rebuff him entirely. 
But then Guenever smiled knowingly at him and bade him to return to her when
he had proved himself to be worthy of her favour. At this, Lancelot was
drunken with pride and joy, and swore he would not fail, but would go to
Logris without delay, there to honour Guenever with noble deeds and battles
chivalrously won. 
Sithen Arthur looked upon Lancelot and said, "There are sieges yet to be
filled at this Round Table, and knights of which I have heard - all
honourable fellows, the which I need - who are held captive by rebel lords
who live beyond my rule. Now, could you but bring them to Camelot as free
men, that would prove you to be a full worthy knight". 
> S
Sir Lancelot went south and was in the great hall of the Round Table. It was
a high-ceilinged room hung about with bright tapestries, and so large was it
that one hundred and fifty knights could be seated. Fragrant rushes covered
the floor; a trampled pathway along the east wall showing where many people
had pushed past the table. Lancelot could see some sieges and a Round Table.

> S
Sir Lancelot went south through the door, mounting his horse and was on the
lawns beside Arthur's castle. The main drive curved north across the grass
and entered into the castle gates. Opposite this, on the south side of the
lawns, stood the cathedral, with its slender wooden spire reaching high unto
the heavens. 
> W
Sir Lancelot rode west and was on the market square, where Lancelot had to
wind his way between makeshift stalls and animal pens. The square was edged
on three sides by inns and the shops of craftsmen, but was open to the east
where wide lawns lay before the cathedral. 
> N
Sir Lancelot rode north and was on the north way, that ran between the
warrens and the royal castle wall. It led on to a wider, paved road out of
the city. 
> N
Sir Lancelot rode north and was on the King's road. It was a wide well-worn
fairway, smoothly paved with flags of stone. The road narrowed to a cart
width as it passed through the northmost city gate. Lancelot knew that this
gate led to Logris, the main part of the country, where he might meet
further adventure. A man at arms strode by and saluted Lancelot as he
passed. 
> N
 
Lancelot was on a wide avenue. It was a fine highway to the north, and fully
paved with flat stones. By order of the king, such roads were kept free of
weeds and smothering bushes. Lancelot could see the Damosel Maledisant.
Lancelot looked about him at the Realm of Logris. Here were fierce dragons
to be fought, and fair damosels to be succoured. Here too were those captive
knights that he must free to complete the company of the Round Table. In
Logris would he prove his worth as a knight, that he might become the
champion of his adored Guenever. 
> DAMOSEL, GREETINGS
The Damosel Maledisant bowed in acknowledgement. 
The Damosel Maledisant said, "Greetings, you poor excuse for a knight. My
lady, Dame Lyonesse, is besieged. She needs help, and I suppose you will
have to do. Though, heaven knows, I ought to have been able to find someone
better". 
> GO TO DAME
Sir Lancelot rode north and was at a crossroads. A fine lady in a carriage,
with a retinue of liveried servants, passed across from east to west at a
steady trot. They soon vanished into the shadows of the trees that lined the
road. 
The Damosel Maledisant entered from the south. 
Sir Lancelot rode west and was on a Roman road through forest Sauvage. 
The Damosel Maledisant entered from the east. 
Sir Lancelot rode west and was on an east-west Roman road, bordered by a
thorn thicket. Lancelot could see some briars. 
The Damosel Maledisant entered from the east. 
Sir Lancelot rode west and was at a great clearing beside the Castle of
forest Sauvage. Cows grazed peacefully beneath the watchful eye of a young
peasant lad. 
The Damosel Maledisant entered from the east. 
Sir Lancelot rode west and was at a junction in the forest. A swine herd
walked slowly up the lower track, driving a fat sow before him. He pulled
his forelock to Sir Lancelot as he passed. 
The Damosel Maledisant entered from the east. 
Sir Lancelot rode north and was on a straight track. 
The Damosel Maledisant entered from the south. 
Sir Lancelot rode north and was on the track outside Turquin's manor. 
The Damosel Maledisant entered from the south. 
Sir Lancelot rode north and was on a country road. 
The Damosel Maledisant entered from the south. 
Sir Lancelot rode north and was at a main road. Lancelot could see some dead
wood and an elm tree. Peasants walked down in the road, by twos and threes,
bearing their goods to market and gossiping the while. 
The Damosel Maledisant entered from the south. 
The meantime, came a lady out of the castle and cried aloud, "O Lancelot,
thou flower of all knights, help me to recover my falcon, for she is slipped
from me and the lunes about her feet are entangled fast in the branches of
yonder elm". 
> UP
Sir Lancelot could not climb the tree while encumbered with his heavy
armour, so he shed himself of its weight and left it heaped upon the ground.
Lancelot dismounted and went upwards and was in the lower branches of the
elm, broad and solid and dusted with green mosses. Pushing the leaves aside,
Lancelot could see the upper branches reaching high above. From far above,
Lancelot heard the hawk mewing miserably. Clearly the bird was trapped up
YONDER. 
> UP
Sir Lancelot went upwards and was at the top of the elm. The branches were
much slimmer here and full of sap, with many a small shoot bursting from the
tips. The wind blew more strongly at this height and the whole treetop
swayed in the breeze. Lancelot could see a hawk. Lancelot grabbed at a
branch as his balance slipped, and the hawk spitefully bit a chunk out of
his hand. 
> UNTIE LUNES
Sir Lancelot untied the tangled lunes, and tossed the hawk down to the
ground. A cry of joy from below heralded its safe arrival. 
> DOWN
Sir Lancelot went downwards and was in the lower branches of the elm, broad
and solid and dusted with green mosses. Pushing the leaves aside, Lancelot
could see the upper branches reaching high above. 
> DOWN
Sir Lancelot went downwards, mounting his horse and was at a main road, a
wide smooth highway, lined with regal elm trees. Lancelot could see Sir
Phelot, the Damosel Maledisant, a Lady, some dead wood and an elm tree. 
As the Lady turned away and wept, Sir Phelot sneered down from his great
horse and taunted Lancelot, "My wife has done as I bade her. Now, without
your armour, you are helpless as a maid. The hour is come that you must
die!" The Damosel Maledisant said "Ha ha! Not so great now, are you,
Lancelot?". The Lady wrung her hands. 
> GET DEAD WOOD
Sir Lancelot took the dead wood. 
Sir Phelot smote Sir Lancelot. Lancelot was but lightly wounded. 
> THROW WOOD AT SIR PHELOT
The wood smote Sir Phelot on the one side of the head, so that he fell in a
swoon upon the ground. Then Sir Lancelot took the sword out of his hand and
struck his head from the body, for Sir Phelot was a false knight who would
have slain Sir Lancelot most treacherously.
 
The lady departed, weeping. And therewithal, Sir Lancelot put his armour
upon him as fast as he might, for he feared an attack from the knight's
castle that stood nearby. 
> GO TO DAME
Sir Lancelot rode north and was at a country junction. As he rested on a
small KNOLL, Lancelot heard the howls of a brachet, far to his right. 
The Damosel Maledisant entered from the south. 
Sir Lancelot rode north and was in the black launds. Lancelot could see the
Black Knight. In its midst waited the knight, clad all in black. 
The Black Knight directed his horse to the middle of the road and sat,
awaiting Lancelot's attack. The Damosel Maledisant entered from the south. 
The Black Knight said, "None shall pass" and blocked Sir Lancelot. 
> ATTACK KNIGHT
Sir Lancelot smote the Black Knight. He was but lightly wounded. 
The Black Knight smote Sir Lancelot. Lancelot was scarcely harmed. 
> ATTACK KNIGHT
Sir Lancelot smote the Black Knight. He was badly hurt. 
The Black Knight smote Sir Lancelot. Lancelot was scarcely harmed. 
> ATTACK KNIGHT
Sir Lancelot smote the Black Knight. He was close to death. 
The Black Knight yielded. Did Lancelot spare him? YES
He rode away, striking Lancelot to the ground as he left. The Damosel
Maledisant said "Ha ha! Not so great now, are you, Lancelot?". 
> GO TO DAME
Sir Lancelot rode north and was in the green launds. Lancelot could see the
Green Knight. In its midst waited the knight, clad all in green. 
The Green Knight said, "None shall pass me". The Damosel Maledisant entered
from the south. 
The Green Knight said, "None shall pass" and blocked Sir Lancelot. 
> ATTACK KNIGHT
Sir Lancelot smote the Green Knight. He was but lightly wounded. 
The Green Knight smote Sir Lancelot. Lancelot was scarcely harmed. 
> ATTACK KNIGHT

The Green Knight smote Sir Lancelot. Lancelot was scarcely harmed. 
> ATTACK KNIGHT

The Green Knight yielded. Did Lancelot spare him? YES
He rode away, striking Lancelot to the ground as he left. The Damosel
Maledisant said "Ha ha! Not so great now, are you, Lancelot?". 
> GO TO DAME
Sir Lancelot rode north and was in the red launds. Lancelot could see the
Red Knight. In its midst waited the knight, clad all in red. 
The Red Knight challenged Lancelot. The Damosel Maledisant entered from the
south. 
The Red Knight said, "None shall pass" and blocked Sir Lancelot. 
> ATTACK KNIGHT
Sir Lancelot smote the Red Knight. He was but lightly wounded. 
He smote Sir Lancelot. Lancelot was scarcely harmed. 
> ATTACK KNIGHT
Sir Lancelot smote the Red Knight. He was badly hurt. 
He smote Sir Lancelot. Lancelot was scarcely harmed. 
> ATTACK KNIGHT
Sir Lancelot smote the Red Knight. He was close to death. 
He yielded. Did Lancelot spare him? YES
He rode away, saluting Lancelot. 
> GO TO DAME
Sir Lancelot rode north and was at a siegeworks. Lancelot could see a horn
and a siege army. The remains of past battles were scattered about the
field, broken swords and spears, and scraps of chain mail and armour. It
seemed to Lancelot that he could hear the echoes of past battles, and ghosts
of long-dead knights seemed to linger on the air. 
The Damosel Maledisant entered from the south. 
A flurry of arrows dissuaded Sir Lancelot. 
> BLOW HORN
A horn sounded. The commander rode up, trembling visibly. 
He had been besieging Dame Lyonesse, but had no wish to do battle with Sir
Lancelot and promised to desist and withdraw his army. He told Lancelot that
he was free to enter the castle at his will. 
He further spoke of the knights of the launds, saying that while the black
and green knights were his true servants, and men of evil ways, but yet the
red knight was a honourable man and a member of the Round Table. He had been
commanded to act as he did. He offered the services of the red knight to
Lancelot. He rode off with his army in a great hurry. 
The Red Knight entered from the north. 
> GO TO DAME
Sir Lancelot dismounted and went north and was in Castle Lyonesse, an
imposing building in smooth pale stone, atop a hill. This EMINENCE's
position gave a view of the surrounding country, like unto that of a
circling eagle. Within, the rooms were light and airy, hung with gay
tapestries. 
Dame Lyonesse greeted Lancelot and thanked him warmly for restoring her
estates unto her. She wished to reward him for his valour and said that
Lynet, the Damosel Maledisant, could stay with him. 
She then retired to tend to her wounded soldiers, and graciously sent
Lancelot on his way. 
The Red Knight entered from the south. The Damosel Maledisant entered from
the south. 
> GO TO BRIARS
The Red Knight waited in readiness. 
Sir Lancelot went south, mounting his horse and was at a siegeworks.

Sir Lancelot rode east and was at a great clearing beside the Castle of
forest Sauvage. 
The Red Knight entered from the west. The Damosel Maledisant entered from
the west. 
Sir Lancelot rode east and was on an east-west Roman road, bordered by a
thorn thicket. Once wide and true but now broken and overgrown, it was made
treacherous by tangled thorns that stretched out to catch the unwary.
Lancelot could see some briars. 
The Red Knight entered from the west. The Damosel Maledisant entered from
the west. 
> KNIGHT, WAIT, CUT BRIARS, CUT BRIARS
The Red Knight said, "Very well". 
> CUT BRIARS
Sir Lancelot chopped away at the briars. 
The Red Knight chopped away at the briars. 
The briars grew again. 
> CUT BRIARS
Sir Lancelot chopped away at the briars. 
The Red Knight chopped through the main stem. The briars shrivelled
magically and disappeared. 
> GO TO CASTLE
Sir Lancelot rode north and was in an apple tree clearing beside Castle
Chariot. 
Lancelot lay him down in the shade, for he was full tired from his travails,
and he fell into a sleep. At length he was awakened by the coming of four
royal ladies, riding forth from the castle. 
The Red Knight entered from the south. Queen Morgan said, "Lancelot, you
must choose one of us to be your beloved, or you will never leave this
forest". The Damosel Maledisant entered from the south. 
Lancelot could not go that way. 
Queen Northgales raised an eyebrow at Lancelot. Queen Outisles smoothed her
gown sensuously. The Damosel Maledisant looked from Lancelot to the Queens
and said, "Humph! If you are going to dally with these trollops, I will be
off". The Damosel Maledisant rode south. 
> CHOOSE GUENEVER
The queens were furious that Lancelot would not choose one of them. Hundreds
of guards sallied from the castle and dragged Lancelot away to a cell
beneath the castle. 
> WAIT
Time passed. 
A maiden entered from the west.

A maiden entered from the west. 
> GIVE WINE TO MAIDEN
Sir Lancelot gave the glass of wine to the maiden. The maiden drank the love
potion and fell in love with Lancelot. Knowing that her new beloved desired
only freedom, she kissed him chastely and opened the castle doors. 
> OUT
Sir Lancelot went outside through the door and was in a north-south prison
corridor, beneath the fortress. The damp sheen on the walls glinted eerily
in the flickering torchlight, and deep were the shadows of the cell doors.
Lancelot could see the Red Knight. A low moan echoed hollowly around the
stone walls. 
He looked around. 
> N
Sir Lancelot went north through the door and was in another prison cell. The
ceiling was so low that Lancelot could barely stand up straight, and puddles
of foul water had collected on the uneven floor. A pile of straw lay in one
corner, by way of a bed, but it was sodden and offered no comfort. Lancelot
could see Gawain. A rat scurried across the floor, paused and sniffed the
air, then ran off swiftly as Lancelot made to kick at it. 
Gawain said, "Lancelot, you are come in my time of greatest peril. How can I
thank you for rescuing me?". The Red Knight entered from the south through
the door. 
> GAWAIN, FOLLOW ME
Gawain agreed. 
> S
Sir Lancelot went south through the door and was in a north-south prison
corridor, beneath the fortress. The damp sheen on the walls glinted eerily
in the flickering torchlight, and deep were the shadows of the cell doors. 
Gawain entered from the north through the door. The Red Knight entered from
the north through the door. 
> OUT
Sir Lancelot went outside, mounting his horse and was in an apple tree
clearing beside Castle Chariot. In the clearing stood on old apple tree, its
branches casting welcome shade on the trimmed grass beneath, its blossom
sweeting the air. Above the encompassing wood rose the battlements and
conical roofs of castle Chariot. 
Gawain entered from the north. The Red Knight entered from the north. 
> GO TO MELIOT
The Red Knight hummed a popular ballad. 
Sir Lancelot rode south and was on an east-west Roman road, bordered by a
thorn thicket. Lancelot could see the Damosel Maledisant. 
Gawain entered from the north. The Red Knight entered from the north. The
Damosel Maledisant was sitting by the side of the road. For a while she
seemed not to see Lancelot. Then, reluctantly, she got up and said, "Well, I
hope you enjoyed yourself". 
Sir Lancelot rode west and was at a great clearing beside the Castle of
forest Sauvage. 
Gawain entered from the east. The Red Knight entered from the east. The

Sir Lancelot rode east and was on an overgrown road. A brachet dozed in the
shade by the roadside. It awoke as Lancelot drew close and ran north,
looking ever backwards to see if he would follow. 
Gawain entered from the west. The Red Knight entered from the west. The
Damosel Maledisant entered from the west.

brachet. The brachet pointed its nose towards the east and began to bay
mournfully. 
Gawain entered from the south. The Red Knight entered from the south. The
Damosel Maledisant entered from the south. The brachet whined pleadingly at
Lancelot. 
Sir Lancelot rode east and was on an overgrown road. As an eagle flew

struggled back up and made his way forward slowly, testing each footfall
with care. 
Gawain entered from the west. The Red Knight entered from the west. The
Damosel Maledisant entered from the west. 
Sir Lancelot rode east and was outside a manor house. There were people
inside there, for Lancelot could hear a soft keening from somewhere within
the manor. 
Gawain entered from the west. The Red Knight entered from the west. The
Damosel Maledisant entered from the west. 
Sir Lancelot dismounted and went north and was in a decaying hall. Debris of
wood and stone littered the floor, where weeds grew amongst the cracked
flags. And birds obviously roosted in the ROCKY ledges of its walls.
Lancelot could see Meliot and a Damosel. The damosel did bend over Sir
Meliot and wept bitter tears. 
Gawain entered from the south. The Red Knight entered from the south. 
Meliot said, "Sir Lancelot, prithee give me succour. My wounds may only be
cured by a cloth belonging to the witch that made them". The Damosel
Maledisant entered from the south.

Sir Lancelot went south, mounting his horse and was outside a manor house.

sounded to the south. 
Gawain entered from the north. The Red Knight entered from the north. The
Damosel Maledisant entered from the north. 
Sir Lancelot rode south and was on a dangerous road. 
A host of swarthy knaves leapt into the track, lashing out at Lancelot with
clubs and scythes. But then anon, within six strokes, Sir Lancelot had
stricken them all to the earth. The survivors fled south for sanctuary,
towards a forest chapel. 
Gawain entered from the north. The Red Knight entered from the north. The
Damosel Maledisant entered from the north. 
Sir Lancelot dismounted and went south and was in the churchyard outside
Chapel Perilous. Lancelot saw, around the entrance of the chapel, many fair
rich shields turned up-so-down. Lancelot recognised many of the shields as
those of former great knights. As he marvelled WHERE they hung, he bethought
himself to hear a scraping. Perhaps swords were unsheathed nearby. 
Gawain entered from the north. The Red Knight entered from the north. The
Damosel Maledisant entered from the north. 
> S
Sir Lancelot went south and was inside the chapel, where dark wooden pillars
rose up to darker rafters. Lancelot could see some Thirty Knights. Each
knight was taller by a yard than any man that ever he had seen, and they all
grinned and gnashed at Sir Lancelot. 
Gawain entered from outside. The Red Knight entered from outside. The
Damosel Maledisant entered from outside. The knights spake all together,
with a grimly voice, and said, "Knight Lancelot, put down your sword
straight away, and go not inside the inner chapel, and we may show you
mercy". 
> S
Sir Lancelot went south and was in the inner chamber, a small cramped room,
with many strange ornaments and relics lining the walls and heaped upon the
floor. The air was stale and foul with the smell of rottenness. Lancelot
could see Hellawes and a cloth. 
Hellawes greeted him in sweet tones, and soft words of loving welcome. She
wept and Lancelot thought he heard music as she said, "Alas Lancelot, if you
do not surrender you WILL die for it. Put down your sword". 
Gawain entered from outside. The Red Knight entered from outside. The
Damosel Maledisant entered from outside. 
> GET CLOTH
Sir Lancelot took the cloth. Hellawes' protests were in vain. As soon as
Lancelot had hold of the magic fabric, there was a great storm and a
tempest. The evil witch vanished, and all her knights with her.

Sir Lancelot rode north and was on the great north road. In places, the
track had been stamped into a hard smooth surface, and here the roadside was
dotted with cairns, and smaller tracks led off to many villages and
settlements along the way. But where few travellers passed, the going was
rough and slow. 
Lancelot remarked upon a great host of pilgrims, the which sat upon the bank
to rest their weary feet. They called their blessings to Lancelot as he rode
past.

Sir Lancelot rode north and was in Scotland. Lancelot found but poor fodder
for his horse and worried ever about ambush. For the rough stone crofts were
home to to a fierce and hardy race. They had but lately fought against King
ARTHUR'S men and Lancelot thought to hear the music of the pipes. 
A rough fellow with a great mane of wild hair drove a herd of great-horned
cows across the road, following the sun to new pasture. 
Gawain entered from the south. The Red Knight entered from the south. The
Damosel Maledisant entered from the south.

Sir Lancelot rode west and was beside a broch. The round tower looked but a
poor fortress, but he knew that its thick stone walls were a strong defence.
A bitter cold wind blew spray from the nearby shore. Lancelot could see a
guard and a portcullis. 
Gawain entered from the east. The Red Knight entered from the east. The
Damosel Maledisant entered from the east. The guard signalled to someone

The Red Knight turned in acceptance. 
He rode upwards.

briefly and then died away. A guard entered from the west.

Sir Lancelot dismounted and went inside and was in a stable, which was the
only room on the ground floor of the broch. Lancelot looked at the stairs to
the west and fancied that the local people lived in the upper levels of the
broch, while there seemed to be cellars below. 
Gawain entered from outside. The Damosel Maledisant entered from outside. 
> GO TO BASEMENT
Sir Lancelot went west and was on the stairs. The grating of a chair on a
wooden floor sounded from somewhere up above. 
Gawain entered from the east. The Damosel Maledisant entered from the east. 
Sir Lancelot went downwards and was at the base of the stairs. 
Gawain entered from above. The Damosel Maledisant entered from above. 
Sir Lancelot went east and was in the basement, a low, damp storeroom. The
air was musty and laced with the pungent smell of liquor that wafted from
some old oak casks set by the wall. A pile of dusty hempen sacks lay heaped
against a great chest. Some sacks had split, spilling little mounds of
barley on to the floor. Lancelot could see a trapdoor. On it was a chest. As
his eyes accustomed to the gloom, Lancelot saw the deeper shadow of a
doorway in the eastern wall. 
Gawain entered from the west. The Damosel Maledisant entered from the west.

Sir Lancelot slid back the bolts. 
The Red Knight entered from the west.

Sir Lancelot went east through the door and was in a prison, a tiny box of a
place with scarce room enough for a man to stand or even to lie at length.
The air was warm and rank with confinement. Lancelot could see Lamorak. A
man sat slumped in one corner. He looked up as Lancelot entered. 
Gawain entered from the west through the door. The Red Knight entered from
the west through the door. Lamorak said, "Hail Sir Lancelot, I cannot tell
you how grateful I am that you have saved me". The Damosel Maledisant

The Red Knight nodded. 
> PUSH CHEST
Sir Lancelot strained against the chest. Too few people were helping. 
The Red Knight strained against the chest. The chest slid away from the
trapdoor. 
> DOWN
Sir Lancelot went downwards and was in a tunnel, cut through crumbling
shale, the roof held up in places by spars of wood. The passage was at times
so low that the going had to be made on hands and knees. A thin rain of dust
trickled down from the ceiling. 
Gawain entered from above. The Red Knight entered from above. Lamorak
entered from above. The Damosel Maledisant entered from above.

Sir Lancelot went outside, mounting his horse and was on a beach, a small
bay forming a deep curve between two jagged headlands. Lancelot fancied to

straight highway stretched east-west as far as the eye could see and had
been laid with flat stones, though weeds now sprouted plentifully in the
cracks. The turret threw a long dark shadow across the way. Lancelot saw the
door of the turret open and close again quickly, yet nobody emerged.

Sir Lancelot rode inside and was in Garlon's turret, a squat tower built of

Lamorak entered from the north. Lancelot heard footsteps follow him inside.
The Damosel Maledisant entered from the north.

With the shutters closed, the turret was completely dark. Lancelot heard
foul cursing from nearby as Garlon realized he had lost the advantage of his
invisibility. 
Gawain examined his sword for small nicks. The Red Knight hummed a popular
ballad. Someone invisible smote Sir Lancelot. Lancelot was scarcely harmed.
The Damosel Maledisant said "That was a cowardly trick".

Sir Lancelot smote someone invisible. He was badly hurt. 
Gawain pressed out a dent in his shield. Lamorak looked around. Someone
invisible smote Sir Lancelot. Lancelot was scarcely harmed.

view between the trees. White mist swirled heavily around the base of its
stark ash grey walls, and crows circled slowly above its tall sharp towers.
It had the air of a place accursed. Lancelot could see Sir Pedivere and Sir
Breunis.

Sir Lancelot went upwards and was in a room with a bath, a small chamber
with a roaring fire. Cauldrons of steaming water hung within the fireplace,
and a huge pile of great towels was set upon a shelf to one side of the
hearth, warming by the fire. The whole chamber was so filled with steam and
the smoke from the fire that it was nigh impossible to see. Lancelot could
see a bath. 
In the bath sat Elaine, naked as a needle, and Lancelot thought that she was
the most beautiful woman that he had ever seen, except for Queen Guenever.
Sir Lancelot led Elaine from the cauldron. She was delighted to be rescued,
but hastened to quit the room and cover her nakedness. At the door, she

Sir Lancelot rode east and was in Corbin village, an INHABITATION where the
people ate mainly fish. A cluster of tiny stone houses around the castle.
Their doors faced inland, and smoke blew furiously from the chimneys. A few
sparse strips of farmed land could be seen behind the cottages. The
villagers cleared a path before Lancelot, pointing and whispering at his
arrival, before running indoors to peer at him from safety.

Sir Lancelot dismounted and went east and was in a chapel beside a tomb, a
squat building, with a simple wooden cross atop its mossy thatched roof.
Within, it was empty, but for a tomb GRAVE and the tick of beetles. Lancelot
found a fiendly dragon in the chapel, laying atop the altar and chewing on a
bone. He draw his sword and set upon the beast, but its fiery breath and
daggered claws were almost a match for his strength and skill. The battle
raged from noon to dusk, till at last, Lancelot, though sorely wounded with
deep scores and burns, slew the great beast with one desperate lunge.

Sir Lancelot dismounted and went inside and was in the hall of Corbin
Castle. Stuffed ducks hung everywhere, trophies of the hunt, to EMBELLISH
the walls. Lancelot could see Elaine. 
King Pelles, father of Elaine had commanded a feast to honour Lancelot. For
he new well the prophesy that Sir Lancelot should get a child upon his
daughter, the which would be named Sir Galahad and would complete Arthur's
Round Table knights. 
The banquet was magnificent and, afterwards, King Pelles bade his goodnights
and withdrew, leaving Elaine and her saviour alone. 
Before Lancelot had time to think of pleasantries, he realized that Elaine
was blushingly flirting with him. In truth, she made her love for him plain.
Then, whispering, "Come to me tonight, in the east bedroom", she slipped
quietly upstairs. 
> UP
Sir Lancelot went upwards and was on the gallery above the hall. There were
bedrooms to east and south. 
Lancelot knew that his honour was at stake. 
> S
Sir Lancelot went south through the door and was in the perilous bedroom. It
was very dark, but Lancelot could make out a large bed with a plump
mattress. Tattered drapes of heavy grey cloth billowed oftimes from the
draughts behind them. Their DEEP shadows moved like strange birds. Lancelot
could see a panel and a bed. On it was a pillow. Lancelot shivered with
cold. Even the wood panels of the walls seemed to allow in the chill
draughts. 
> GET PILLOW
Sir Lancelot took the pillow. 
> LIE
Lancelot fell asleep straightway. But during the night he was awakened by
the creaking of the panel opening. A glowing spear flew from within the
opening. It smote Lancelot in the shoulder, wounding him sorely, then it
vanished. The panel ground shut again. Sir Lancelot was gravely wounded.

Lancelot fell asleep straightway. But during the night he was awakened by
the creaking of the panel opening. An old man emerged, enveloped in adders
which seethed constantly around him. In his hand he bore a spear of
vengeance. 
> WAIT
Time passed. 
> WAIT

The old man blessed Lancelot for not attacking him, and sang how Joseph of
Arimathea had come into that land to prepare the way for the Grail. Then he
returned through the panel.

Lancelot fell asleep straightway. But during the night he was awakened by
the creaking of the panel opening. Four gentlewomen and a bishop emerged,

grounds and the bedroom door opened to permit Lancelot to leave.

Sir Lancelot went north through the door and was on the gallery above the
hall. There were bedrooms to east and south. As Lancelot readied himself to
leave the castle, he met Dame Brisen, who was Elaine's lady and the greatest
enchantress that was in the world. 
Dame Brisen brought Lancelot a cup of drugged wine, and showed him a ring,
like that worn by Guenever, and said that the Queen was waiting for him. And
Lancelot weened that maiden Elaine had been Queen Guenever and he took her
in his arms. 
When they had lain together, Lancelot remembered himself and left. But his
anger and guilt did not last, because it was not by his intent that he was
unfaithful to Guenever. And Lancelot knew that it was his fate to sire
Galahad by Elaine, despite all his efforts.

fishermen appeared and came up to Lancelot. Speaking softly, as if in fear
of being overheard, they warned him about the lord of Servage, saying that
Sir Nabon le Noir was an evil giant who was wont to eat his visitors. And
that, even then, a knight was awaiting his doom in the castle prison. 
Sir Pedivere entered from below. Gawain entered from below. The Red Knight
entered from below. The Damosel Maledisant entered from below.

Nabon. Lancelot could see Giant Nabon and a keyhole. 
The giant spoke, "Sir Lancelot, I fear you not, for it was prophesied that I
should be slain by a blow from the right hand of a saint. But that cannot
be, for I hewed the right hand from the only saint that ever was in these
parts, and now keep it in my pillow. So be you afeared, Sir Knight, for
tomorrow we shall fight and you shall die". The giant laughed savagely then,
yawning, returned to his bed to sleep.

The Red Knight put the pillow underneath Giant Nabon. The giant slept on
soundly. 
> LOOK IN SACK
It was a large hessian sack. In it was a relic. 
> EXAMINE RELIC
It was the mummified hand of some long-dead saint. It was black and dry like
a piece of charcoal. The fingers had shrivelled to long thin claws. 
The Red Knight waited in readiness. 
> HIT GIANT WITH HAND
The giant collapsed in a pile of dust as the saintly hand struck him full on
the head. 
Sir Pedivere examined his sword for small nicks. The Damosel Maledisant said
"Cowardly beast".

another. 
The Red Knight opened the door. The Damosel Maledisant said "Methinks you
needed help".

pit was set into the centre of the floor. Lancelot could see Bors de Ganis,
Sir Pedivere, the Damosel Maledisant, a winch and a lever. 
The cage descended. Sir Pedivere apologised for not finishing his task. He
hummed a popular ballad. The Damosel Maledisant told Lancelot what a poor
knight he was.

Sir Lancelot went south and was in the central courtyard of Turquin's manor,
a small stone-flagged square. A solid, ugly building with barred windows lay

annoyed. 
Bors de Ganis pressed out a dent in his shield. Sir Pedivere directed the
boat to the west. The boat was on the sea. The water was glassily still, and
so deep as to be a rich blue-black. As giant waves passed, the children of
distant STORMS, Lancelot watched the fish leap. In it were Bors de Ganis,
Sir Pedivere, Gawain and the Damosel Maledisant.

Sir Lancelot rode west and was on a winding road. As Lancelot rode, he saw a
liveried figure of a herald hastening from the west. He stopped before the
knight and cried, "O Lancelot, flower of chivalry, now have I found thee".
He caught his breath and spoke on, "I bring news from King Mark of Cornwall,
besieged in Tintagel. The Sessoine host have landed from their ships and lie
in siege about the city. My lord bade me ride through their army and to
bring King Arthur's knights to our aid. Prithee come with all speed!"

entered from below. The Damosel Maledisant entered from below.

The land about the castle was filled with the tents and hosts of a besieging

that led down to the beach where lay a great fleet. 
Bors de Ganis entered from the southeast. Sir Pedivere entered from the
southeast. Gawain entered from the southeast. The Damosel Maledisant entered
from the southeast. A ripple of fear ran through the army as Lancelot came

that was Lancelot, and waved it on. The carter rode northeast. The cart was
on a beach. Lancelot could see a carter, a cauldron, a fire and some ships.

Bors de Ganis agreed. 
He was in excruciating pain. He put the hot coals in the cauldron. 
> BORS, GET CAULDRON THEN GO UP, DROP CAULDRON
Bors de Ganis promptly agreed. 
He took the cauldron. Sir Pedivere looked around. A carter entered from the
southwest. Bors de Ganis was in excruciating pain. 
> UP
Sir Lancelot dismounted and went upwards and was on board a Sessoine
warship, close by the bare main mast. The timbers creaked beneath his feet,
and the air was thick with the smell of pitch. Lancelot could see a pile of
sails. Neither on this ship nor the others of the fleet was there a man to
be seen, for all had gone to assist in the siege. 
Bors de Ganis entered from below. Sir Pedivere entered from the south.
Gawain entered from the south. Bors de Ganis was in dreadful pain. 
> WAIT

He was in excruciating pain. He put the hot coals on the pile of sails. The
sails caught fire! Full fiercely did they burn, the flames spreading fast to
engulf much of the deck, and carried by the breeze to set afire the others
of the fleet. Lancelot had scarce enough time to flee the deck before it was
completely ablaze. 
Their fleet lost, the Sessoines could do nought but surrender. King Mark of
Cornwall declared Lancelot a hero and bade him enter the city in triumph. 
> GO TO CORNWALL

spears along towards the sea edge. Though at their ease, they seemed ever
watchful.

northeast. Gawain entered from the northeast. 
Sir Lancelot rode southwest and was on a walled road. 
Bors de Ganis entered from the northeast. Sir Pedivere entered from the
northeast. Gawain entered from the northeast. 
Sir Lancelot rode northwest and was at Tintagel, the headland jutting out
fiercely into the foaming ocean below. Atop the sheer ESCARPMENT rose the
dark grey castle, surrounded by wheeling seagulls. Its battlements commanded
the sea approaches from Wales and the lands of north Cornwall behind. The
country to the south was green and gently rolling, at odds with the harsh
coast. 
Bors de Ganis entered from the southeast. Sir Pedivere entered from the
southeast. Gawain entered from the southeast. 
> IN
As Lancelot entered the castle, King Mark stepped forward. "Welcome, Sir
Knight", he said, "You have our thanks for ridding us of our besiegers. But
I know that they were helped by Sir Tristram, your fellow knight of the
Table Round, and my prisoner. I cannot chance that you will seek to free
him".
 
Thereupon, King Mark signalled treacherously to his guards, who seized
Lancelot and threw him into the dungeons. 
Tristram said, "Hello Lancelot, have you brought my harp?" Bors de Ganis
entered from the south. Sir Pedivere entered from the south. Gawain entered
from the south. 
> GIVE HARP TO TRISTRAM
Sir Lancelot gave the harp to Tristram. He said, "Thank you". 
He played a hauntingly beautiful tune, his fair head bent low over the harp,
engrossed in his music. Soon all the guards fell under the enchantment of
his music, and gladly opened the cells. Then Tristram led the escape of the
prisoners by leaping down from the chapel window.

hope you enjoyed yourself".

The Damosel Maledisant entered from the north.

paved with flags of stone. The road narrowed to a cart width as it passed
through the northmost city gate. 
> GO TO ARTHUR
Sir Bors de Ganis sharpened his sword. Sir Lancelot rode south and was on
the north way, that ran between the warrens and the royal castle wall.

the market square, where Lancelot had to wind his way between makeshift
stalls and animal pens.

Sir Bors de Ganis entered from the west. 
Sir Lancelot alit from his horse and walked north through the door and was
in the great hall of the Round Table. Lancelot could see some sieges and a
Round Table. 
Sir Bors de Ganis entered from the south through the door. 
Sir Lancelot went north and was in Arthur's echoing hall. Hundreds of wall
torches gave a flickering gold glow to the room, making it seem welcoming
despite its size. Lancelot could see Guenever and King Arthur. 
Sir Bors de Ganis entered from the south. Guenever referred to a sheaf of
letters from Lynet, the Damosel Maledisant, in which she described
Lancelot's deeds and praised him full highly. She passed them on to Arthur,
who read the reports and smiled. 
Then Arthur stood and proclaimed to all that Lancelot had proved himself the
best knight in all the land and a worthy champion for its Queen. 
Guenever left, inviting Lancelot to join her and her knights, in the Maying
celebrations in the meadows of Westminster. King Arthur frowned at a young
servant who had slopped water on the floor. 
> GO TO MEADOWS
Sir Lancelot went south and was in the great hall of the Round Table.
Lancelot could see some sieges and a Round Table. 
Sir Bors de Ganis entered from the north.

Sir Lancelot rode west and was on the market square, where Lancelot had to
wind his way between makeshift stalls and animal pens. Lancelot could see a
town crier. 
Sir Lancelot rode south and was on the south way, before the Bishop's Gate.
Peasants and traders, on their way to market, mingled with city folk and
priests about their business. 
Sir Lancelot alit from his horse and walked south through the door and was
inside the Bishop's Gate, that guarded the southern entrance to the city. A
soldier sauntered through the gate and emptied a slop bucket into the river
beyond. 
Sir Lancelot went south, mounting his horse and was on the bridge over the
River Camel. The river gurgled beneath the rough-hewn timbers. A peasant boy
climbed from below the bridge and scuttled away. He had a fishing line in
his hand and three fine fat fishes hanging from his belt. 
Sir Lancelot rode south and was outside the Bishop's Gate. The road
stretched away southwards across broad green meadows and into woodland
beyond. 
Sir Lancelot rode south and was in Westminster meadows. The lush wet grass
was dotted with clumps of fragrant wild flowers. Lancelot could see a
carter. He was driving a cart. Lancelot found the queen was no longer there,
and all around were the signs of a battle but recently fought. Those around
cried that Queen Guenever had been captured by Sir Meliagaunt and carried
off southwards to his castle. They shouted their anger and set out in
pursuit, and grim-faced Lancelot rode with them. 
> GO TO MELIAGAUNT
The carter collected some straw from the meadows. 
Hidden archers shot and killed his horse from under Lancelot.

Sir Lancelot went inside and was in Meliagaunt's hall. In the stone hearth,
a fire sputtered and struggled to stay alight. A draught from the open
windows had blown out the flames on some of the wall torches, and they but
smoked sullenly. Lancelot could see Sir Meliagaunt. As Lancelot thrust
through the door, yet furious for the death of his horse, the defenders of
Castle Meliagaunt turned and ran. 
Sir Meliagaunt seemed sore afraid to see Lancelot. 
> WAIT
Time passed. 
Sir Meliagaunt went upwards. 
> UP
Sir Lancelot went upwards and was on the stairs, leading up to a landing,
with doors to the north, west and south. The stone treads were wide and
flat. Lancelot could see Sir Meliagaunt. Lancelot climbed the stairs,
three-at-a-time, eager to make sure the Queen was safe. 
Sir Meliagaunt went north. 
> N
Sir Lancelot went north and was in the royal suite, which had been pressed
into service as lodgings for the Queen's Knights. Straw beds had been set
up, and a trestle table laid with wines and sweetmeats. Lancelot could see
some Queen's knights and Sir Meliagaunt. Lancelot came upon the knights as
they tended their wounds from their battle with Meliagaunt's men. Those who
could, stood to attention and cheered their saviour. As he walked amongst
them, Lancelot heard the fair voice of Guenever coming from a room to the
north. 
Sir Meliagaunt went north. 
> N
Sir Lancelot went north and was in Guenever's boudoir. It was richly
furnished, even to having a carpet upon the floor, and was filled with a
scent of fresh lavender. A robe of finest silk lay folded neatly over an
oaken chest, and soft satin slippers had been set beside the bed. Lancelot
could see Guenever, Sir Meliagaunt and a bed. The sounds of gardeners at
work drifted up through the barred window. 
Sir Meliagaunt knelt to Guenever, "My Queen, forgive me for trying to kidnap
you. It was done in a moment of madness". 
Guenever stared at Lancelot, who looked for a moment as though he might slay
Sir Meliagaunt where he knelt. Then the Queen drew herself up to her full
height, and insisted that Lancelot should spare him. As it was late,
Guenever made it known that she would spend the night at Meliagaunt's
castle. But she made it clear that Lancelot would be on hand to protect her
and that her knights would sleep outside her door. 
As he turned to leave, Guenever whispered in Lancelot's ear, "Come to me
tonight, my saviour".

Sir Lancelot went south and was in the royal suite, which had been pressed
into service as lodgings for the Queen's Knights. Straw beds had been set
up, and a trestle table laid with wines and sweetmeats. Lancelot could see
some Queen's knights. 
Sir Meliagaunt entered from the north.

Sir Lancelot went west and was in the guest suite, a comfortable, airy room,
with rushes and rose petals fresh strewn upon the floor, and a cheerful fire
burning in the hearth. Lancelot could see a bed and a chest. A servant
appeared and asked courteously if Lancelot had need of ought for his
comfort. Lancelot thanked her and sent her away. 
> EXAMINE CHEST
It was about a yard high and made of oak. The heavy lid opened from the top,
but the hinges had rusted from lack of use. In it were some gloves and a
hat. 
> TAKE GLOVES AND HAT
Sir Lancelot took the gloves. 
Sir Lancelot took the hat.

Sir Lancelot went downwards and was in Meliagaunt's hall. In the stone
hearth, a fire sputtered and struggled to stay alight. A draught from the
open windows had blown out the flames on some of the wall torches, and they
but smoked sullenly. 
> OUT
Sir Lancelot went outside and was on the east side of castle Meliagaunt. It
was set high on an ISTHMUS in a lake, wafted by the perfume of its moat.
Only the narrowest of windows broke its smooth stone walls. It was strong
and solid, built to withstand any siege. Lancelot could see no way in save
over the drawbridge. And no way in at all when that was raised. The sentries
on the battlements watched Lancelot silently. 
> W
Sir Lancelot went west and was in a formal garden, with short hedges of box
and lawns of soft scented camomile. Lancelot could see a window. Judging by
the greenery all about, the gardeners were losing their long battle to keep
the walls clear of ivy. 
> UP
Overcome by passion for Guenever, Lancelot bent back the thick iron bars and
climbed within. His hand was hurt, but he paid no heed to its slight
bleeding... 
When Lancelot awoke the next morn, he heard the sound of footsteps
approaching from within the castle.

oaken chest, and soft satin slippers had been set beside the bed. Lancelot
could see Guenever, Sir Meliagaunt and a bed. 
Sir Meliagaunt was standing over the Queen, his sword poised to strike.
Tense and white with anger, Meliagaunt spat out an accusation of adultery
against the Queen.
 
Lancelot, inflamed by his words, sprang to her defence, and challenged
Meliagaunt to a battle for the Queen's honour. Sir Meliagaunt curled his lip
at the young knight and accepted the challenge, setting the time for three
days thence. Sweeping up his weapons, he called the castle guards, ordered
the window to be secured, and left angrily with the Queen, clutching her
tightly by the arm.

The lights went out and the floor gave way, with a great splintering.
Lancelot dropped a long way and smote his head, not waking until much later.

> LOOK
Lancelot was in a small dark prison. The stone walls were soft and damp to
the touch and the air was rank with mould and decay and a thin smattering of
dirty straw covered the floor. The only light came from a tiny barred
window, set high up against the ceiling. Lancelot could see a damosel. 
> WAIT
Time passed. 
The damosel promised Lancelot his freedom if he would promise to love her,
giving her a kiss to seal the bargain. 
> WAIT
Time passed.

The damosel sighed and left. The damosel went outside.

The damosel told Lancelot that Guenever was to be executed that day, as her
champion had not appeared to defend her honour. The damosel saw his grievous
suffering and, filled with pity, offered to free Lancelot in exchange for
just a kiss, with no promise intended. 
> KISS DAMOSEL
Sir Lancelot kissed the damosel, and she opened the door and left. A new
horse was found, and Lancelot made ready to go. 
> GO TO GUENEVER
Sir Lancelot went outside and was in Meliagaunt's hall. In the stone hearth,
a fire sputtered and struggled to stay alight. 
Sir Lancelot went north, mounting his horse and was on the east side of
castle Meliagaunt. 
Sir Lancelot rode north and was on a straight way, that ran broad and true
through a well-kempt wood. A fair damosel sang gaily as she picked the May
blossom, while her stout escort snored peacefully in the shade. 
Sir Lancelot rode north and was in Westminster meadows. 
Sir Lancelot rode north and was outside the Bishop's Gate. 
Sir Lancelot rode north and was on the bridge over the River Camel. The
river gurgled beneath the rough-hewn timbers. 
A carter entered from the north. 
Sir Lancelot alit from his horse and walked north and was inside the
Bishop's Gate, that guarded the southern entrance to the city. 
Sir Lancelot went north through the door, mounting his horse and was on the
south way, before the Bishop's Gate. 
Sir Lancelot rode north and was on the market square, where Lancelot had to
wind his way between makeshift stalls and animal pens. 
Sir Lancelot rode east and was on the lawns beside Arthur's castle. The main
drive curved north across the grass and entered into the castle gates.
Opposite this, on the south side of the lawns, stood the cathedral, with its
slender wooden spire reaching high unto the heavens. Lancelot could see a
crowd, Sir Meliagaunt and a pyre. Fastened to it was Guenever. 
The crowd started a slow hand-clap. Sir Meliagaunt stoked the fire. 
> FIGHT MELIAGAUNT
Meliagaunt was sorely afeared of Lancelot and agreed to fight only when
Lancelot offered to take off half his armour and have one hand tied behind
his back. This was done, and the two did come to fight. 
"This will take but a moment!" called Meliagaunt, and so it did. For
Lancelot taunted Meliagaunt with his naked side, and when the other did
lunge at him, Lancelot stepped apace and with one mighty blow, clove
Meliagaunt in two, even down to his breastbone. 
Thus was the honour of the Queen proven and Guenever freed. 
Guenever thanked Lancelot for saving her, and was gracious as befitted her
rank, but tears stood in her eyes. 
 
Now all the Knights of the Round Table were assembled, saving only one, and
life proceeded apace at court. Lancelot lived happily, always triumphing in
the many tournaments that were held, performing valiant deeds on the hunts,
and oftimes taking pleasure in secret with Guenever. 
 
Full twenty years passed thuswise, until a prophecy appeared above the one
yet empty seat at the Round Table, the Siege Perilous. This read, FOUR
HUNDRED WINTERS AND FOUR AND FIFTY ACCOMPLISHED AFTER THE PASSION OF OUR
LORD JESUS CHRIST OUGHT THIS SIEGE TO BE FULFILLED. And so it was, for
Galahad the Haut Prince arrived at Camelot that very day, and the company
was complete. 
 
That evening, the Holy Grail appeared to the knights, as is described in the
book. But it departed all too soon and the most part of the company swore to
find its resting place and perhaps bring the Grail back to Camelot. 
 
Lancelot knew that he must put aside earthly pleasures and see Guenever no
more. He retired to his chamber to prepare for the events of the morrow,
setting aside his armour and weapons for the moment. But he knew he could
not, in honour, leave without saying goodbye to his love. 
> E
Sir Lancelot went east through the door and was on the stairs. His footsteps
on the bare stones echoed around the walls. His bedchamber lay to the left
of the half-landing, past a window that looked out over the lands
surrounding Camelot. A maidservant scurried past him and up the rightmost
stairs, carrying a jug of hot perfumed water. 
> E
Lancelot was in Guenever's bedchamber, a place of soft warmth and feminine
comfort, perfumed by pomanders and rich spices. Embroideries of scenes from
romantic legends, hung on the walls. Lancelot could see Guenever, a
footstool and a bed. 
Guenever smiled serenely. There was a knock on the door. 
> GUENEVER, WAIT, CLOSE DOOR
Guenever promptly agreed. 
> OPEN DOOR
Sir Lancelot opened the door and a knight entered. 
Guenever closed the door. Sir Colgreavaunce smote Sir Lancelot. Lancelot was
unhurt. 
> KILL COLGREAVAUNCE
Sir Lancelot struck down the knight and stripped him of his armour and
weapons. Feverishly, he threw the armour on himself, and Guenever's nimble
fingers saw to the fastenings. Thus armed, he flung open the door and drove
off the other knights like dogs.
 
Lancelot had once again proved his honour, and that of the Queen, in combat.
And, on the following day, he departed with the other knights to seek the
Holy Grail.

The company of knights went each his own way, all searching for the Holy
Grail. But Lancelot lagged behind, worried lest he fail in his duty, and had
barely reached Vagon Castle, at the eastern side of Camelot, when darkness
came... 
 
Lancelot was in Vagon castle where he had spent the night, bedded on rough
straw as befits one who would follow Our Lord. The drip of water echoed off
the bare stone floor and walls. Lancelot could see an altar. Only the altar
had been dressed with colour and richness. 
What now? PRAY 
Sir Lancelot, the dutiful knight, bended his knee and made humble prayer at
the holy altar, that God would bless his quest. For it was not by sword, but
by the will of the Almighty that the Holy GRAIL might be attained. 
What now? OUT
Sir Lancelot went outside, mounting his horse, and was on a track leading
east. The squat bulk of Vagon Castle dominated the western skyline, its dark
grey turrets standing out against the sky. Occasional peasants and
men-at-arms trudged past along the track. They were returning to ARTHUR'S
city from the distant forest, their passage raising much dust, for it had
not rained for many a day. 
What now? E
Sir Lancelot rode east and was at a fork in the road, marked by a great
stone cross. A rough and narrow track led southeast through a thorn thicket,
while to the northeast lay a wide road, that ran smooth into the distance.
Lancelot could see a bejewelled crown and a stone cross. Lancelot mopped his
brown, FOR the weather was hot. Then he seemed to hear the clear ringing of
church bells to the left. 
What now? EXAMINE CROSS
It was a stony cross bearing the inscription, "This way to peace" (pointing
to the northeast) and, "This way to death" (pointing to the southeast). 
 
Lancelot slept beside the cross and dreamt of a goodly knight, led astray by
a fair damosel. 
What now? NE
Sir Lancelot rode northeast and was on a paved road leading north, with a
fine smooth surface of dressed stone flags, its grass verges close mown and
speckled with small bright flowers. Sparrows and finches sang gaily in the
well-kempt beech hedges on either hand, before flying low into the nearby
woodland. 
What now? N
Sir Lancelot rode north and was outside a fine church with a tall, turreted
tower and high arched windows of stained glass. From the neatly dressed
stonework of the buttresses to the copper windvane atop the leaded roof, it
spoke of great craftsmanship and dedication to the glory of its lord.
Lancelot could see a smiling preacher. 
 
The preacher stepped forth, from where he had been standing just outside the
chapel porch and said, "Sir Lancelot, prince amongst knights, I greet you. I
know of your quest and can help. If you will but pay me with the jewelled
crown as a token of service to my Lord, I will help shorten your quest for
the Holy Grail". 
What now? MAKE SIGN OF CROSS
Sir Lancelot made the sign of the cross. The smiling preacher was revealed
as a fiend, spun around and and disappeared, cackling foul insults, into the
air. 
What now? S
Sir Lancelot rode south and was on a paved road leading north, with a fine
smooth surface of dressed stone flags, its grass verges close mown and
speckled with small bright flowers. 
What now? SW
Sir Lancelot rode southwest and was at a fork in the road, marked by a great
stone cross. A rough and narrow track led southeast through a thorn thicket,
while to the northeast lay a wide road, that ran smooth into the distance.
Lancelot could see a bejewelled crown and a stone cross. 
That's enough "What now" prompts. 
> SE
Sir Lancelot rode southeast and was on a thorny track leading south through
a dense growth of brier and bramble. Lancelot could see a penniless cleric
and a thorn thicket. Long, sharp thorns clawed at Lancelot's cloak, slowing
his passage, and Lancelot pressed his horse hard to one side to allow a
woodman to pass with a heavy bundle of sticks. The peasant sweated under
their weight and under the sun that beat on his back. 
> S
Sir Lancelot rode south and was in shady woodland, on a winding path that
ran north and east below the canopy of leaves. The great beeches rose high
on either side, their dense crowns touching and all but shutting out the
sky. Sunlight dappled the branch tips and stray shafts broke through and
danced in the woods beneath. Lancelot could see a knight. 
 
The knight urged his steed down the track towards Lancelot, tilted his lance
in greeting and said, "Hold fast traveller, I will give passage to any
knight but he that is called Sir Lancelot. By your leave, please tell me
your name". 
Some pious priests entered from the east. 
> KNIGHT, LANCELOT
"Then die, Sir Lancelot!" he cried, urging his mount into the charge and
swinging his sword about him. 
The knight smote Sir Lancelot. Lancelot was slightly injured. 
> ATTACK KNIGHT
Sir Lancelot smote the knight. He was unharmed. 
He smote Sir Lancelot. Lancelot was sorely hurt. The pious priests greeted
the knight cheerfully. He asked for their blessing, which was gladly given. 
> ATTACK KNIGHT
Sir Lancelot smote the knight. He was almost unharmed. 
The knight smote Sir Lancelot. Lancelot was gravely wounded. The pious
priests went north. 
> ATTACK KNIGHT
Sir Lancelot smote the knight. He was almost unharmed. 
The knight smote Sir Lancelot. Lancelot was nigh unto death. 
> ATTACK KNIGHT
Sir Lancelot smote the knight. He was slightly hurt. 
The green knight had Lancelot at his mercy. He raised his sword to MAYBE
strike the final blow, but then held back and lowered his blade. "Sir
Lancelot," he said, "I must avow that you have fought bravely, and I shall
spare your life. You are free to pass". 
> E
Sir Lancelot rode east and was on an east-west woodland road in the middle
of a dense forest. A profusion of bright flowers bejewelled the smooth green
sward all around. A shaft of sunlight shone down TO the middle of the
clearing. Lancelot could see a damosel and a resplendent pavilion. The
damosel stepped forward and, raising her slender arms in welcome, invited
him inside. The weary knight was entranced by her soft tones and her great
beauty, and he looked upon her in wonder as she beckoned towards the
pavilion. 
> IN
The fair damosel took Lancelot by the hand and led him into the pavilion.
Sir Lancelot dismounted and walked inside and was in an airy pavilion that
was clad in soft shade, lit only by the warm glow of sunlight filtered
through the gay fabrics of the tent. Lancelot could see a damosel and a
comfortable bed. The damosel held out a plate of three dainty cakes to
Lancelot, saying "Please eat your fill". 
The damosel said, "Please eat the cakes, for my sake if not for yours". 
> MAKE SIGN OF CROSS
Sir Lancelot made the sign of the cross. The pavilion turned up-so-down, and
then it changed unto a smoke, and a black cloud, and in an instant the
resplendent pavilion vanished in a whirling cloud of evil. Lancelot was
adread and called aloud to Jesu Christ for help that he might complete the
quest. 
> E
Sir Lancelot rode east and was at a ford across a south-flowing river. Full
steep and rocky were the valley sides on either hand. A tumble of elder,
larch and willow found purchase on the western side, yet opposite was nought
but stunted gorse. Lancelot could see a black knight. 
 
Of a sudden, the black knight rode out to greet Lancelot crying, "No worldly
knight shall pass me". And straightway he smote Lancelot a mighty blow that
spilled him to the ground. 
> E
The black knight stood aside and waved on Sir Lancelot. Lancelot rode east
and was in a bleak wasteland with only a couple of clumps of coarse grass
and stunted heathers struggling to survive in the hard stony ground. All was
silent in that barren land, save for the faint sound of distant running
water. High above, a heron winged steadily eastward, beating a lonely track
through a vast empty sky. 
> E
Sir Lancelot rode east and was at the crossing of two roads. The stony waste
stretched out both east and west as far as the eye could see. To the north
it was bounded by a high cliff, its rugged face crossed by a thin straggling
path. Southwards, a patch of dusty greenery told of water and human
habitation. Lancelot could see a stone cross. 
> EXAMINE CROSS
It was the height of a man and fashioned in the Gaelic manner, with a circle
at the juncture of arms and upright. The surface had been carved with
flowing patterns, and smoothed by the sands that blew across the waste. 
 
Lancelot slept beside the cross and had a dream. He thought he came to a
great place which seemed a chapel, and there he found a tree on the one side
that was wormeaten and weak, and on the other side a lily. And him thought a
good man said, "Should not he do great folly that would let this flower
perish to succour the rotten tree, that it dropped not to earth?". 
> N
Sir Lancelot rode north and was at the base of a cliff, so tall and rugged
that its top was scarcely to be seen. Coarse leaved trees grew low amongst
the tumbled rocks. Two salamanders FOUGHT lazily in the hot sunshine. Then,
seeing the knight, they turned and scuttled swiftly up a rough path. 
> UP
Sir Lancelot rode upwards and was on a rocky path amongst the shrubs that
grew at the base of the cliff. The path bended sometimes to left and right,
but travelled generally eastwards and upwards. 
 
A follower of Nacien the Hermit ran down the path towards Lancelot,
shouting, "Turn back from this path, I beg you". Then he vanished as swiftly
as he came. 
> UP
Sir Lancelot rode upwards and was on a steep path part way up the cliff.
Here it narrowed as it wound its way around a rugged outcrop. 
 
A second disciple appeared and pleaded, "Oh, worthy knight. Why dost thou
condemn us, that do you no harm?" Then he withdrew behind the ridge. 
> UP
Sir Lancelot rode upwards and was on a path near the top of a cliff close to
the top. The shrubs far below were mere splashes of green amongst the stark
shadows of the jagged rocks at the base of the cliff. 
 
A third follower of Nacien came forth and said unto Lancelot, "Turn back
from this path, I beg you. Else my lord says that all his disciples must
cast themselves from the cliffs above". Then he ran away upwards. 
> UP
Sir Lancelot rode upwards and was on a path outside a hermitage, a crude
stone hovel with a battered roof of turves. A sheepskin hung across the
entrance and flapped loosely in the wind that gusted across the clifftop. 
 
A fourth robed figure arrived to plead with Lancelot. "I am Nacien", he
claimed, "Please come no further, for it is written that we are doomed
should you attain the hermitage". He raise his hands in supplication, then
disappeared. 
> IN
Sir Lancelot rode inside and was in Nacien's hermitage, a place of cold
austerity. The crude lodgings of a man who had forsworn the comforts and
pleasures of this world. Lancelot could see Nacien the Hermit. 
 
Nacien laid aside his Bible and rose from his low stool as Lancelot entered.
He heard the knight tell his tale of visitations upon the cliff path, and
shook his head in wonder.
 
Right well had Lancelot done to press on, for it was not the hermit's
followers, but fiends in their images, which had sought to turn Lancelot
aside from the true path. Nacien praised Lancelot for his faithfulness, in
pressing on against an enemy he could not fight with weapons, and offered
unto him a CHALICE. 
> GET CHALICE
Sir Lancelot took the beautiful chalice. 
Nacien the Hermit sat cross-legged on the floor. 
> OUT
Sir Lancelot rode outside and was on a path outside a hermitage, a crude
stone hovel with a battered roof of turves. A sheepskin hung across the
entrance and flapped loosely in the wind that gusted across the clifftop.

Sir Lancelot rode south and was at the crossing of two roads. The stony
waste stretched out both east and west as far as the eye could see. To the
north it was bounded by a high cliff, its rugged face crossed by a thin
straggling path. Southwards, a patch of dusty greenery told of water and
human habitation. Lancelot could see a stone cross. 
Galahad entered from the south. 
> S
Sir Lancelot rode south and was beside a well encompassed by a low wall of
dressed stone. A clump of hardy trees grew close by, giving welcome shade in
that dry, dusty land. Lancelot could see a thirsting pilgrim and a well. The
sunshine glinted harshly off a great white building on a slight HILL to the
south. 
The pilgrim muttered, "Have pity upon me, kind sir. I have not drunk for
nigh on a week". A penniless cleric entered from the south. 
> GIVE CHALICE TO PILGRIM
Sir Lancelot gave the beautiful chalice to the thirsting pilgrim. With the
help of Lancelot, the pilgrim reached into the well and filled the chalice.
He drank deeply, and was forthwith revived by the healing holy water. He
handed the chalice back to Lancelot, rose up and once more set out upon his
pilgrimage. 
The penniless cleric went north.

Sir Lancelot rode east and was on a stony road that tracked through the
wasteland. His horse picked a careful passage between the hard flints and
troublesome pebbles. Through the wavering air that rose from that hot earth,
Lancelot could see a distant wall of green in the east. 
> E
Sir Lancelot rode east and was on a forest ride of smooth sward. Gentle
breezes stirred the trees WHILE Lancelot rode along.
 
Then, of a sudden, the woodland peace was shattered by the appearance of a
cruel dwarf with lustful rage burning in his eyes. He dashed off through the
HAZES to the south, his knife at the throat of a trembling maid.
 
As he passed, a group of knights appeared, riding north, and between them
they bore Sir Ector, bound naked to his mount. And they flogged his body
with sharp thorns that tore his flesh. For certain, there would be little
time to rescue both, but should he turn first in aid of the innocent maiden
or of his own brother? 
Galahad entered from the east. 
> S
Did you know that you can go quickly to a far off place? E.g "RUN TO BOAT"
or "GOTO CHAPEL".
Sir Lancelot rode south and was in a flower strewn glade surrounded by oaks
and flowering shrubs on all but the northern side. As Lancelot rode out into
the sunlight, the vile dwarf released his helpless victim and took to his
heels in terror. The maiden gave her heartfelt thanks to her saviour and
bade him farewell.

Sir Lancelot rode north and was on a forest ride of smooth sward.

Sir Lancelot rode north and was in a woodland glade encompassed entirely by
close-set oaks. There was no way out save for the southern path whence
Lancelot had come. 
 
In the midst of the glade, Lancelot found Sir Ector beset by a merciless
band of knights. Yet cowardly were they, as well as evil, and at the sight
of Lancelot they fled forthwith without a fight. The worthy knight freed Sir
Ector, who thanked him most gratefully before setting off once more upon his
own quest. 
> GO TO ABBEY
Sir Lancelot rode south and was on a forest ride. 
Sir Lancelot rode west and was on a stony road. 
Lancelot heard a voice call in urgent warning, "Galahad is in danger for his
life". Lancelot took direction from the voice and hastened to the aid of his
son, riding swiftly to the place where he was in danger... Lancelot was on a
steep path. Lancelot could see Galahad and some barbarous knights. 
> WAIT FOR GALAHAD
Time passed. 
Galahad greeted Lancelot as his father, and it were marvel to tell of his
joy. 
 
The evil knights called out, "Lancelot, flee for your life, or die at our
hands. We intend to kill Galahad, and nought you can do shall prevent us. 
> KILL KNIGHTS

Sir Lancelot smote the barbarous knights. They were almost unharmed. 
Of a sudden, the skies opened, and bolts of lightning struck down Galahad's
foes to left and right, and those fled in terror that were not slain. One
last great bolt struck the stake and loosed Galahad from his bonds. The
young knight dropped to his knees and humbly gave thanks to the lord for his
deliverance. Then rising, he turned to Lancelot and offered to help him to
attain the Grail. 
> GALAHAD, FOLLOW ME
Galahad nodded. 
He knelt down and prayed. 
> GO TO ABBEY
Sir Lancelot rode downwards and was on a rocky path.

Galahad entered from the north. 
Sir Lancelot rode south and was in the white ABBEY, standing square in the
centre of the nave, between the slender fluted pillars of solid silver that
rose high to the soaring vault of the ceiling. Lancelot could see a circular
shield and a huge tomb. 
Galahad entered from the north. 
> GALAHAD, GET SHIELD
Galahad said, "Very well". 
Galahad knelt and prayed, then Galahad took the circular shield. 
> EXAMINE TOMB
It was made of great slabs of stone. It was undecorated, but bore the
daunting inscription, "Only the best knight in the world may open this tomb
and live". The tomb was closed. 
Galahad prayed for strength. 
> GALAHAD, OPEN TOMB
Galahad nodded. 
Galahad opened the huge tomb. A foul fiend emerged with a hideous shriek,
that clawed at his heart like talons of ice and fire. 
> GALAHAD, KILL FIEND
Galahad agreed. 
Galahad said "God our father will protect us". Galahad advanced and struck
out at the fiend. As he did so, a host of angels sprung to his aid and,
quailing before their power, the fiend fled. 
> EXAMINE TOMB
It was made of great slabs of stone. It was undecorated, but bore the
daunting inscription, "Only the best knight in the world may open this tomb
and live". In it was a dead body. 
> EXAMINE BODY
It was the body of a false christian, an unbeliever whose presence was a
focus of evil in the consecrated ground. 
Galahad knelt down and prayed. 
> GO TO BOAT

Galahad entered from the west. 
Sir Lancelot rode east and was on a forest ride. 
Galahad entered from the west. 
Sir Lancelot rode east and was on a bleak shore, whipped by the cold salt
wind and battered by the surging waves. Lancelot's TOUR had brought him to
this place, but he found little here to treasure. Lancelot could see a boat.
In it were a metal-rimmed horn and a shining sword. 
Galahad entered from the west. 
> GALAHAD, GET SWORD

He took the shining sword.

place, but he found little here to treasure. In it was Galahad. 
> BLOW HORN
Sir Lancelot blew the horn, and a magical wind sprang up. 
Galahad said "My prayers have been answered. Praise be to God". He sank into
silent meditation. 
> GALAHAD, GO TO TURNANCE
Galahad nodded.

was Galahad.

Time passed. 
Galahad directed the boat to the southeast. The boat was on the isle of
Turnance. In it was Galahad. 
> OUT
Sir Lancelot got out. 
Galahad got out. 
> UP
Sir Lancelot rode upwards and was on a path that wound up the cliff
zigzagging narrowly up the steep and jagged face. The footing was
treacherous, worn smooth by the passage of many people and by the rivulets
of water that trickled down from above. 
 
A poor fisherman appeared and said, "Good knight, give us succour! Two great
dragons are laying waste to this isle and striking terror into my people.
They live yonder in clearings at the ends of that path". He pointed swiftly
eastwards, then ran off with a terrible wailing. 
Galahad entered from the north. 
> E
Sir Lancelot rode east and was on a small hillock clad with springy turf and
fragrant heathers. It rose like an island out of a sea of trees. A path
wound across the KNOLL, all twisted like the engraving on a silver cup, and
disappeared among the trees on either side. An angry roar rumbled from the
woods to the south and was echoed by another mighty roar in the far north. 
Galahad entered from the west. 
> GO TO RED DRAGON
Sir Lancelot rode north and was on a path leading north along a cliff top. A
ragged strip of blood-stained sackcloth hung from a jagged branch tip, left
by some poor peasant in his flight. 
Galahad entered from the south. 
Sir Lancelot rode north and was on a path through a pine wood. 
Galahad entered from the south. 
Sir Lancelot rode north and was at a clearing amongst the pines surrounded
by blackened, broken trees. The bare ground has been scorched and stamped by
the dragon in its unceasing fury, until it was as hard and unyielding as
stone. Lancelot could see a red dragon. A poor, solitary sapling was caught
by a sudden breath of wind and nodded towards the great beast. On the
instant, it lashed out a massive red claw and tore the young tree bodily
from the ground. 
Galahad entered from the south. The red dragon smote Sir Lancelot. Lancelot
was slightly injured. 
> S
Sir Lancelot rode south and was on a path through a pine wood deep within
the wood. To the north, the path opened into a clearing, its entrance marked
by two shattered, burnt tree stumps. 
Galahad entered from the north. A red dragon entered from the north. 
> S
Sir Lancelot rode south and was on a path leading north along a cliff top

spear on either side, bushes were trampled and great branches broken, as if
by the passage of some massive beast. 
Galahad entered from the north. A red dragon entered from the north.

> GO TO BLACK DRAGON
Galahad smote the red dragon. It was unharmed. And smote Sir Lancelot.
Lancelot was sorely hurt. 
Sir Lancelot rode south and was on a path straggling down from a hillock.
The wood was silent save for the quiet rustlings of small timid creatures
that crept warily through the undergrowth. 
Sir Lancelot rode south and was on an overgrown path. A coughing roar came
from the southern end of the path, followed close by a billow of black
smoke. 
Sir Lancelot rode south and was in a blackened clearing strewn with fallen
trees, their boughs trampled and flattened. The air was heavy with acrid
smoke and the stench of dragon. Lancelot could see a black dragon. Lancelot
peered through the gloom, but could see no paths out, other than the one by
which he had come. 
The black dragon smote Sir Lancelot. Lancelot was sorely hurt. 
> N
Sir Lancelot rode north and was on an overgrown path within a dismal wood. A
haze of smoke blocked out the sun, and the poor light that seeped through
was absorbed by the soot and ash that lay thickly all around. 
A black dragon entered from the south. 
> N
Sir Lancelot rode north and was on a path straggling down from a hillock
heading south into a gloomy wood, the trees stunted and clad with grimy
leaves.

Lancelot. Lancelot was slightly injured. A black dragon entered from the
south. 
> WAIT
Time passed. 
Galahad smote the red dragon. It was unharmed. 
 
The red and the black dragons set about each other forthwith and fought a
roaring, savage battle. At last the great red beast dropped to the ground,
wounded unto death. Yet even as it died, it gave a mighty lash with its
flailsome tail that did break the neck of its slayer. When all was still,
the people of the isle came up and brought unto Lancelot a cup of mead in
token of their gratitude. 
> GO TO BOAT
The red dragon was dead. 
Lancelot the dragon-slayer rode west and was on a path that wound up the
cliff.

Galahad looked holy.

> GO TO ANTECHAPEL
Sir Lancelot rode east and was on a pavement. At the other end, Lancelot
could see a squat grey antechapel, its ancient walls part clad in glossy
ivy. 
Galahad entered from the east. 
Sir Lancelot dismounted and walked east and was in an antechapel, a small
room, lined with panelling of pale oak and furnished with pews of the same
warm wood. A single candle was set in a holder on one wall and sent a
flickering pale light into the room. Lancelot could see Bors, Percival and a
heavy key. Bors and Percival were there and bowed low to Lancelot, and
welcomed him that he had joined them. 
Bors greeted him. "Hail, Lancelot. Percival and I are here to help you".
Percival agreed, "We will give you whatever aid we can". Galahad entered

Sir Lancelot took the heavy key. A fire spirit appeared. 
The salt water quenched the fire spirit entirely. A water spirit appeared.
The sand soaked up the water spirit. A sand spirit appeared. Galahad blew
the horn, and a magical wind sprang up. The wind blew away the sand spirit
and scattered it. Singing voices told Lancelot to have faith in God and to
walk onwards to the Grail. 
> UNLOCK DOOR
Lancelot the spirit-slayer opened the door. 
Bors prayed for guidance. Galahad said "My prayers have been answered.
Praise be to God". 
> E
Lancelot the spirit-slayer went east through the door, mounting his horse,
and was in a dark valley lined with standing stones. The eternal guardians
of the way, their heavy presence weighing on the spirits of all who walked
between their serried ranks. A deep rumbling came from the east, and it
rolled among the silent stones and echoed from the valley walls. 
> E
Lancelot the spirit-slayer dismounted and walked east and was in a castle of
gaunt grey stone. A flight of steps, guarded by two great lions, lead up to
a door at the eastern end. Lancelot could see some savage lions. At the
sight of Lancelot, the lions leaped up as if to block the way to the east. 
> E
Lancelot the spirit-slayer went east and was in a majestic corridor wide
enough for six knights to ride abreast, and high enough to fly a falcon. The
walls were hung with richly embroidered tapestries and the flags of kings
and princes. Though no sound reached the ear, it seemed there was the music
of angels close at hand. Glorious light beckoned him from a chamber at the
eastern end. 
> E
Lancelot the spirit-slayer went east and was in the Grail chamber, a room of
light and life. Heavenly sunlight streamed through the tall windows of
stained glass and filled the chamber with the colours of glory. Lancelot
could see the Holy Grail. 
 
And angels did sing while the holy Joseph of Arimathea did say mass for the
knights. Lancelot dropped on bended knee and gave grateful thanks to the
Lord for that he had fulfilled his quest. 
 
At length, Lancelot withdrew from the chamber of the Holy Grail, and
eventually returned to Camelot. The worthy knights, Galahad, Bors and
Percival were also blessed and did attain the Grail in the fullness of time.
 
Lancelot returned to Camelot, where he told Arthur of his deeds, and then,
at length, he retired to serve God as a hermit.
 
As for the history of Arthur and of Guenever, that is for another time.
Meanwhile, congratulations on winning this game!..
