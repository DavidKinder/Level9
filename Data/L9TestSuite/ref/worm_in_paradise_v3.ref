Afterwards, the third Kimberley herself rewards you for providing further
evidence that enemy aliens exist, and so strengthening the hand of the
government in their attempt to hold onto power. The Kim tries to look
genuinely grateful as she rewards you with full party membership, but you

life is in danger unless you can get some leverage on her. Two droids run up
