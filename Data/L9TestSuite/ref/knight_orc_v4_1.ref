Grindleguts struggled awake, groaning piteously. The world bucked and
swayed, his headache was agony and he ached in every limb. Grindleguts'
mouth tasted like a Hobbit's armpit and he seemed to have lost another tooth
- he could not quite remember what had happened after they captured the Inn,
yesternight, but he was sure it must have been fun! He moaned again and
prepared to wallow in his hangover. 
 
A sharp object stabbed at Grindleguts' ribs again, interrupting his
enjoyment of his misery. Grindleguts risked ungluing one bloodshot eye and
squinted at the world. A shaft of sunlight stabbed back. It was still light.
It was very light! Some idiot had woken him in the middle of the day!

What now? #SEED 42
E
You, Grindleguts, leap furiously at the jabbing figure beside you - and
discover, to your horror, that your legs are fastened to some huge animal!
To the shrill sound of human merriment, you slide slowly round the horse to
which you have been tied and hang helplessly below it. 
 
Your captors are dressed in a variety of styles, from long white robes to
the full armour of a knight, mounting another horse nearby. He catches your
glance and curls his upper lip in disdain. "You don't stand a chance, little
man", he says, spitting contemptuously, "I can't think why the orcs chose
you as their champion". Lowering his visor, he rides out into the full
sunlight. 
 
One of the robed figures hauls you back upright, jeering "Go on, Sir Orc,
you're next" and gives your horse a prod with his spear, laughing as the
frightened beast rears and bolts. 
 
What now? E
You bravely charge the knight. 
The knight takes aim and, WHOOMPH, his lance meets your chest and you fall
backwards, breaking your bonds. The crowd roar as you fall, stunned, to the
hard ground .... 
 
Some time later, you awake. Bruised and battered, but you must be still
alive! At first it seems to be night, but you gradually realise that you are
buried. 
 
You are in a huge pile of garbage, with the other rubbish thrown away after
the tournament. An exit leads downwards and outside. You can see a putty
knife and a hooded cloak. 
What now? TAKE KNIFE AND CLOAK
You take the putty knife. 
You take the hooded cloak. 
What now? WEAR CLOAK
You wear the hooded cloak. 
What now? EXAMINE KNIFE
It is rusty and blunt, barely able to carve the slime off a puddle. 
A male voice in the distance shouts, "Does anyone have any treasure to
spare?" 
What now? OUT
You go outside and are on a trampled field, pock-marked by the feet of
humans and their horses. An exit leads west. You can see a pile of garbage. 
What now? W
You go west and are on a jousting field; an acre of firm meadow, divided by
a fence which guides and separates the contestants. The grass is surrounded
by garish pavilions and a tented grandstand, big enough for hundreds of
people to watch the fight. Exits lead north, east, south and west. 
What now? N
You go north and are on a dismal fairground in a rowan coppice. In the
distance is a castle. Exits lead in all directions and inside. You can see a
flagpole. 
A female voice in the distance shouts, "Hey! Give that back!" 
What now? EXAMINE FLAGPOLE
It is an ugly white post, a hundred feet tall, stuck in the mud. Fastened to
it is a halyard. 
The prophet enters from the northeast. 
We won't bother with "What now" from now on. 
> TAKE HALYARD
You take the halyard. 
> GO TO CASTLE
You go northwest and are in a juniper thicket. 
You go northwest and are outside an ugly castle in a hornbeam tangle. Exits
lead in all directions and inside. You can see a drawbridge. The drawbridge
is closed. 
> EXAMINE DRAWBRIDGE
It is a moving bridge, nailed together from big tree-trunks, which can be
swung down across the castle's moat and allow you to enter. The drawbridge
is closed. Fastened to it is a note. 
A male voice in the distance shouts, "Are there any orcs listening?" 
> READ NOTE
It is printed with "Knock very carefully" in many languages, including
cartoons for Yellow Eye Readers. It also warns that the drawbridge can't be
re-opened from inside the castle. 
> THROW KNIFE AT DRAWBRIDGE
It hits the drawbridge, which flies open and hits the ground with a thump,
narrowly missing you. 
The drawbridge is wide open. 
> TAKE KNIFE
You take the putty knife. 
A male voice in the distance shouts, "Anyone seen the orc? I want to kill
it." 
> N
You go north and are standing on the drawbridge which leads into the castle.
Exits lead north, inside and outside. 
> DROP KNIFE
You drop the putty knife. 
> N
You go north and are in a cobbled castle courtyard, surrounded by untidy
ranks of wooden sheds which sprawl crookedly against the outer stone walls.
Your guts rumble in sympathy with the tempting sounds of byre and stable,
and the pungent smell of the mews soon gets the saliva flowing.
 
High above this homely chaos rears the stark square masonry of the keep; an
ominous white door leading into its grim interior. Exits lead north through
a door, south and outside. You can see a great chest and an ominous white
doorway. 
> N
You go north through the door and are in the single, large entrance hall at
the base of the keep. Its soft mudrock floor has been polished smooth by use
and the route from the entrance door to the back of the hall has worn into a
ditch. The rounded treads of a spiral staircase emerge from the end of this
furrow and coil upwards into the wall. Exits lead south through a door and
upwards. You can see the knight in white satin. The pallid knight leaps up
in a rage. "How dare you enter my home", he splutters, "You will pay for
this insult!" 
> UP
You go upwards and are on the dangerously rounded steps of a narrow, sunwise
stone staircase, which winds upwards within the stone wall of the keep.
Exits lead upwards and downwards. 
> UP 
You go upwards and are on a stone walkway, between the rotting planks of the
patched roof and the pitted limestone parapet around the edge of the keep.
From this high lookout, there is a dizzying view across the whole forest
though you can't quite make out the orc lair beyond the viaduct. In the
distance is a gibbet, a clearing, a crossroads, a fairground, a forest lawn,
a cave, a royal oak, a tower, a viaduct and a well. An exit leads downwards.

A female voice in the distance shouts, "Does anyone have any treasure to
spare?" 
> RUN TO CLEARING
The pallid knight leaps up in a rage. "How dare you enter my home", he
splutters, "You will pay for this insult!" 
You are in a clearing in a rowan edgewood. In the distance is a castle.
Exits lead in all directions. You can see a goat. 
Synonym the wizard enters from the northwest. A female voice in the distance
shouts, "I've got a valuable golden ruler." A male voice in the distance
shouts, "Does anyone have any treasure to spare?" 
> EXAMINE GOAT
It is an obnoxious creature with sharp horns. It is tied up with a tether. 
Synonym the wizard mumbles quietly. The goat stares at you. A male voice in
the distance shouts, "Anyone seen the orc? I want to kill it." 
> TAKE TETHER
You take the tether. 
> TIE TETHER TO HALYARD
The ropes join magically. 
Synonym the wizard gives you a long stare. The goat goes north. 
> RUN TO ROYAL OAK
You are inside the rotten trunk of the royal oak, in a wide chamber lined
with leaves and cobwebs. Just enough light seeps in from outside for you to
be able to see the ridged and knotted wood all around. An exit leads
outside. You can see a gold sovereign and a washing line. 
A male voice in the distance shouts, "I've just found a valuable golden
rod." A male voice in the distance shouts, "Right, you asked for it!" 
> TAKE WASHING LINE
You take the washing line. 
> TIE LINE TO ROPE
The ropes join magically. 
A male voice in the distance shouts, "Are there any orcs listening?" 
> TAKE SOVEREIGN
You take the gold sovereign. 
> GO TO WELL
You go outside and are beside the royal oak in an alder tangle. 
You go east and are in a beech heartwood. 
You go east and are in a beech scrubland. 
You go east and are beside a quaint little well in a beech spinney. In the
distance is a castle. Exits lead in all directions and downwards. You can
see a welcome mat and a hardwood roller. 
> EXAMINE MAT
It is decorated with the following message: 
"Welcome to the Orc's Head Inn, prop B.Wallop, purveyor of the only beer in
all Middle Earth. 
Rules of the tavern: no credit, no spitting, no smoking, no killing unless
provoked, no elves without a health certificate, no hobbits without a lead,
no snakes, rabid dogs or orcs allowed". Underneath it is a key. 
A male voice in the distance shouts, "Help!" 
> TIE ROPE TO ROLLER
You fasten the coil of rope to the hardwood roller. It hangs down into the
depths of the well. 
> DOWN
You climb the rope... . You go downwards and are at the bottom of the well,
standing ankle-deep in mud. An exit leads upwards. You can see a hessian
hawser and a bucket. 
> TAKE HAWSER
You take the hessian hawser. 
> UP
You go upwards and are beside a quaint little well in a beech spinney. In
the distance is a castle. Exits lead in all directions and downwards. You
can see a welcome mat and a hardwood roller. 
A male voice in the distance shouts, "Can someone tell me how to get down
the well?" 
> UNTIE ROPE
You unfasten the coil of rope. 
> TIE HAWSER TO ROPE
The ropes join magically. 
> TAKE MAT AND KEY
You take the welcome mat. A key falls from under the mat and clatters on the
ground. 
You take the key. 
A male voice in the distance shouts, "How do I get through the Paradise
Gate?" 
> NW
You go northwest and are beside a gibbet in a beech ghostwood. In the
distance is a castle. Exits lead east, south, southeast, southwest and west.
You can see a barrow wight and a wolf. 
It paces up and down. 
> EXAMINE GIBBET
It is a homely construction, used for executions. "A good thing too", you
think, "If more criminals were hung, there would be less of them after the
loot". Fastened to it is a noose. 
The barrow wight paws the ground. 
> TAKE NOOSE
You take the noose. 
The wolf stares at you. 
> TIE NOOSE TO ROPE
The ropes join magically. 
The wolf paces up and down. A male voice in the distance shouts, "Goodbye
folks, I'm leaving." 
> W
You go west and are a little way south of a tower, separated from it by a
thorn hedge in a beech forest. In the distance is a castle. Exits lead
north, east, south, southeast, southwest and west. 
A voice in the distance shouts, "Hey! Give that back!" 
> PUT MAT ON HEDGE
You put the welcome mat on the thorn hedge. 
> N
You clamber over the hedge. You go north and are at the base of the tower
where Rapunzel lives. It is a peculiarly spiky building with no way in.
Exits lead south and upwards. You can see Rapunzel. Rapunzel is looking out
of an upper window of the tower, pouting sexily and letting down her
incredibly long hair. 
She gives you a dirty look. 
> CUT HAIR
You cut off a good length of Rapunzel's hair, by hacking at it with nails
and teeth. Rapunzel shouts angrily, hauls in her remaining tresses and
disappears into the tower. You hear loud cursing and threats of vengeance
against orcs. 
> TAKE HAIR
You take the piece of plaitted hair. 
> TIE HAIR TO ROPE
The ropes join magically. 
> GO TO CROSSROADS
You go south and are a little way south of a tower, separated from it by a
thorn hedge in a beech forest. 
You go southeast and are in a beech scrubland. 
You go southeast and are in a beech wildwood. 
You go east and are at a crossroads in a beech woodland. In the distance is
a castle. Exits lead in all directions. You can see some signposts. 
> EXAMINE SIGNPOSTS
They are two signposts, set at opposite corners of the crossroads. They
indicate "NOWHERE" to west, north and east. 
A horn blatts in the distance and you hear hooves approaching at a gallop. 
> TIE ROPE BETWEEN SIGNPOSTS
You fasten the coil of rope between the signposts. The rope is now tied
tightly between the two posts, making an effective trip-wire. 
A male voice in the distance shouts, "Stop attacking me!" 
A mounted hunter bursts through the trees and spurs his nag towards you.
Repeated shouts of "Yoiks! Tally ho!", Together with his choice of red as
camouflage, demonstrate his hunting skill. The fool is waving a lassoo and
clinging on for dear life. 
> EXAMINE HUNTER 
He is a chinless wonder, dressed neatly in hunting pink and jodhpurs. He is
riding a swift horse. The hunter is carrying a poignard and a lassoo. 
The stupid hunter doesn't see your rope! His horse ducks under it and runs
away, but he is caught mid-chest and hurled, stunned, to the ground at your
feet. 
> TAKE LASSOO
You take the lassoo. 
A male voice in the distance shouts, "Does anyone have any treasure to
spare?" 
> UNTIE ROPE
You unfasten the coil of rope. 
> TIE LASSOO TO ROPE
The ropes join magically. 
A female voice in the distance shouts, "Are there any orcs listening?" 
> RUN TO FOREST LAWN
Genghis takes the gold sovereign. 
You are on a forest lawn in a hornbeam underbrush. In the distance is a
castle. Exits lead in all directions. You can see the green knight. He is
riding a green horse. The green knight is carrying a war axe and some reins.

> EXAMINE KNIGHT
He is "A handsome, parfait knight, great-muscled, fit and slim. 
Almost a giant in height, and long and straight of limb. 
Clad all in green is he, and green his skin and hair. 
His eyebrows are mossy, bright emerald his stare. 
No shield, helm or plastron, nor bright chain mail has he. 
Of armour he has none. Just, in one hand, holly. 
Storm-like and strong, he seems. And swift to strike and stun. 
Dreadful his blows, one deems. Once dealt, true death has come." 
 
In other words, he is a bully of the worst type. He is riding a green horse.
The green knight is carrying a war axe and some reins. 
> TAKE AXE
You take the war axe. 
The green knight puffs himself up and stares down scornfully from the back
of his overgrown pony, 
"If thee be brave, not coward base, 
Then thee must now my challenge face. 
With this, my axe, strike blow for blow. 
I'll let thee strike first. Have a go!" 
He indicates his mighty axe. 
 
> KILL HORSE 
With a surprisingly dextrous stroke you behead the horse. The green knight
shouts in surprise but, before he can retaliate, the massive steed has
fallen on him! He is trapped, but only for the time being. 
The green knight looks dazed. A male voice in the distance shouts, "How do I
get through the Paradise Gate?" 
> TAKE REINS
You take the reins. 
The green knight struggles on the ground. 
> TIE REINS TO ROPE
The ropes join magically. 
With a massive effort, the green knight clambers to his feet and dusts
himself down. The green knight takes the head. 
> N
You go north and are in a hornbeam scrubland. Exits lead in all directions. 
> N
You go north and are in a hornbeam ghostwood. Exits lead in all directions. 
> N
You go north and are in a hornbeam coppice. Exits lead in all directions. 
> W
You go west and are in a hornbeam clump. Exits lead in all directions. 
A male voice in the distance shouts, "I want some gold." 
> W
You go west and are in a holly edgewood. Exits lead in all directions. You
can see a gold heart. 
> TAKE GOLD HEART
You take the gold heart. 
> GO TO CASTLE
You go southeast and are in a hornbeam forest. 
You go southeast and are in a hornbeam scrubland. You can see the valkyrie. 
She goes west. You go east and are in a hornbeam spinney. 
You go east and are outside an ugly castle in a hornbeam tangle. Exits lead
in all directions and inside. You can see a drawbridge. The drawbridge is
wide open. 
> N
You go north and are standing on the drawbridge which leads into the castle.
Exits lead north, inside and outside. You can see a putty knife. 
A male voice in the distance shouts, "Anyone seen the orc? I want to kill
it." A male voice in the distance shouts, "Who's stolen all the treasure?" 
> N
You go north and are in a cobbled castle courtyard, surrounded by untidy
ranks of wooden sheds which sprawl crookedly against the outer stone walls.
Your guts rumble in sympathy with the tempting sounds of byre and stable,
and the pungent smell of the mews soon gets the saliva flowing.
 
High above this homely chaos rears the stark square masonry of the keep; an
ominous white door leading into its grim interior. Exits lead north through
a door, south and outside. You can see a great chest and an ominous white
doorway. 
> UNLOCK CHEST
The lock opens with a little click. 
> OPEN CHEST
The chest swings open. The hinged lid is prevented from falling backwards
too far by a cord tied between it and the chest. 
> TAKE CORD
You take the cord. The heavy lid falls backwards and strikes the ground with
a tremendous crash. 
Denzyl enters from outside. 
> TIE CORD TO ROPE
The ropes join magically. 
Denzyl scratches himself. 
> DROP KEY
You drop the key. 
A male voice in the distance shouts, "Right, you asked for it!" 
> DROP AXE 
You drop the war axe. 
Denzyl mumbles quietly. 
> FIND CAVE
You go south and are standing on the drawbridge. You can see a putty knife. 
Denzyl enters from the north. 
You go south and are outside an ugly castle in a hornbeam tangle. You can
see a drawbridge. The drawbridge is wide open. 
You go east and are in a juniper heartwood. 
Kris the ant-warrior enters from the south. You go east and are outside a
cave in a juniper scrubland. In the distance is a castle. Exits lead in all
directions and inside. 
> IN
You go inside and are in the hermit's horrid little cave, decorated with
cartoons and Christmas cracker mottos. An exit leads outside. You can see
the hermit and a trophy cabinet. 
> GIVE GOLD HEART TO HERMIT 
You give the gold heart to the hermit. The hermit examines it and bursts out
laughing. 
The hermit turns his back on you and walks over to his trophy cabinet. His
shoulders are shaking with mirth. He puts the gold heart inside the trophy
cabinet. 
> HIT HERMIT
While the hermit isn't looking, you clobber the old fool on the back of his
head and knock him out cold. 
> EXAMINE HERMIT
He is unconscious. He is wearing a belt and some saffron robes. 
> TAKE BELT
You take the belt. 
A male voice in the distance shouts, "Goodbye folks, I'm leaving." 
> TIE BELT TO ROPE
The ropes join magically. 
A female voice in the distance shouts, "Hey! Give that back!" 
> RUN TO INN
You are in the public bar of the Orc's Head Inn, squashed between serried
ranks of shove-halfpenny games and the lacquered bar top with its sticky
puddles and rows of imitation kegs. Magic wall-trumpets whine with Hobbit
and Westron music and the mood is one of gloom and depression. It all makes
you quite homesick. Exits lead east, west and outside. You can see the
innkeeper, an empty glass and a bar. 
The innkeeper scratches himself. 
> EXAMINE BAR
It is just the right height to rest your chin on. You avoid doing this,
though, in case it gives people ideas. Underneath it is a spear. 
The innkeeper examines the spear. 
> TAKE SPEAR 
You take the spear. 
The innkeeper polishes the bar. 
> RUN TO VIADUCT
You are just north of a broken viaduct in a pine grove. In the distance is a
castle. Exits lead north, northeast, east, south, west and northwest. 
> TIE ROPE TO SPEAR
You fasten the coil of rope to the spear. 
> S
You go south and are standing on the viaduct, just north of a huge gap where
the southern end of the viaduct has been washed away. To the south, across
the chasm, is a huge orc's head, carved from the rock. Its nose seems to
have been damaged, but enough remains to hold a large metal ring over the
gap in the viaduct. An exit leads north. 
A male voice in the distance shouts, "Right, you asked for it!" 
> THROW SPEAR
A funny little gnome appears on the horizon and sprints towards you, yelling
"Stop! I don't know if you are allowed to do that". He waves a book as he
runs, shouting, "To prove that you are, tell me one word from The Sign of
the Orc, by Peter McBride. What is the word at page 34, line 4, word 3?"
WORD 
The gnome runs past you and vanishes into the distance.
The spear sails through the air and neatly slips through the ring! An
excellent shot! And just in time too, because an ugly crowd of people
advance to block your retreat. The green knight stalks forwards, eager for
revenge, and you stumble backwards into the chasm. There is no way back now!

 
Fortunately, the spear has lodged securely in the ring above, and the rope
hanging from it proves surprisingly strong, so the effect is that you
escape, swinging in a graceful arc through the air, jeering at your pursuers
all the while... 
 
And crunch into the far wall of the chasm. After a long while, the darkness
fades, the stars clear and the land stops spinning, so you stagger upright
and check for signs of damage. Not many bones are broken but, patting at
your cranial ridge, you discover with a shock that you are wearing some kind
of visor - and presumably have been doing so all along! It seems to have
been knocked loose and can be raised at any time from now on. However, I
would advise you to leave it in place until you've explored the land south
of the chasm. 
 
Do you want to follow my advice and leave the visor alone? YES 
 
Welcome to "Hordes of the Mountain King" and "A Kind of Magic", the next
parts of Knight Orc from Level 9 Computing, copyright (c) 1987. 
(This version allows you to use RAM SAVE and RAM RESTORE to save a position
in memory, and OOPS to take back bad moves). 
 
You stroll around the side of Orc Mountain, whistling merrily and working
out how to most impress the other orcs with your great cleverness. Not
everyone could have escaped, single handed, from so many humans! You
recognize a rocky outcrop outsider the lair, whoop happily, "Hey! Oink,
Brainz, I'm home!" and promptly get smacked on the nose by a thrown log. 
 
As you waken, you see a group of orcs standing around. "Who'd a thought it,"
snorts a pig-like individual, "Stupid Grindleguts didn't even bring us any
food. I vote we eats him." Luckily, the other orcs are too busy rifling your
possessions to listen. 
 
After fighting over who gets what, the orcs jostle their way south towards
the archway to the orc lair, leaving you penniless. 
 
You are just south of a glowing gate on a grassy plain. Exits lead south,
southwest and west. You can see a silver loaf. 
> S 
You go south and are at an archway beside a huge mountain to the east. Exits
lead north, east, south, southwest, west and northwest. You can see an
ancient inscription. 
> READ INSCRIPTION
It is a poem: 
"In deep grottos where no one goes, 
rats nibble toes, ghosts moan their woes 
and nothing grows: you need what glows. 
 
In velvet night where nothing's bright, 
all corners tight, no ways are right, 
fight the wight's bite: glow casts a light. 
 
In pitchest dark where monsters bark, 
boojum is snark, choices are stark, 
to meet the mark, glow makes a spark." 
 
The letters are carved into the stone and look slightly luminous. 
A far-off female voice shouts, "Anyone seen any orcs?" 
> E
You go east. It is dark. 
> CAST GLOW AT ME
You are now glowing. You are at a crossover between passageways. Exits lead
east, south and west. 
> E
You go east and are at a junction in the passageway. Exits lead north, south
and west. 
A far-off female voice shouts, "I want to kill me an oik!" 
> N
You go north and are in a dim tunnel, too long to be properly lit by your
GLOW spell. Exits lead east, south and west. 
A remote male voice shouts, "Are there any orcs listening?" 
> W
You go west and are in the headquarters cave of the Orc Lair, from where
past hordes have sallied forth to burn and despoil the Land, and to where
they returned with treasure and food. An exit leads east. You can see Grok. 
> FOLLOW OINK
You go east and are in a dim tunnel. 
Oink enters from the east. 
> EXAMINE OINK
He is a greedy orc with a wide nose, cold feet and a chip on his shoulder.
He is wearing a steel helmet. 
Oink goes west. 
You go west and are in the headquarters cave of the Orc Lair, from where
past hordes have sallied forth to burn and despoil the Land, and to where
they returned with treasure and food. An exit leads east. You can see Grok
and Oink. 
> FOLLOW OINK
He goes east. 
You go east and are in a dim tunnel, too long to be properly lit by your
GLOW spell. Exits lead east, south and west. You can see Oink. 
He goes south. 
You go south and are at a junction in the passageway. Exits lead north,
south and west. You can see Oink. 
He goes west. 
You go west and are at a crossover between passageways. Exits lead east,
south and west. You can see Oink. 
He goes south. 
You go south and are in a maze of little dust-dry passages. Exits lead
north, south and southeast. You can see Oink. 
He goes south. 
You go south and are in a maze of dry little dusty passages. Exits lead
north and east. You can see Oink. 
He goes east.

He goes east. 
You go east and are in a maze of dusty dry little passages. An exit leads
west. You can see Oink and some wriggly writing. 
> STEAL HELMET
You take the steel helmet. Oink is enraged by the theft. He snarls, "So, you
want to fight!" 
He attacks you, but you dodge. 
> RUN TO GROK
You are in the headquarters cave of the Orc Lair, from where past hordes
have sallied forth to burn and despoil the Land, and to where they returned
with treasure and food. An exit leads east. You can see Grok. 
He says, "Why haven't you brought me any food?" 
> EXAMINE GROK
He is the leader of the orcs - a great bully, all scars and stink. Grok has
survived countless take-over bids by other orcs, including one where your
falling tree flattened his head a bit. He never found who did that,
fortunately, but other "candidates" have not been so lucky; one reason why
you meet so few orcs nowadays. He is carrying a crumpled map. 
> READ MAP
Grok hides the map and shouts, "Get your hands off my map! And where's my
rat pie?" 
> WEAR HELMET
You wear the steel helmet. 
A far-off female voice shouts, "Hi folks, I'm back!" 
> FIND RAT PIE
