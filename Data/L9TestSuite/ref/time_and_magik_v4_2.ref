Welcome to Red Moon, the second part of Time and Magik, copyright (C) 1988
from Level 9 Computing and Mandarin. 
 
In the parallel realm of Baskalos, the arcane arts mirror our technology. At
the time when the the Red Moon crystal was the sole active source of magik,
its theft was a potential disaster for the history of both worlds. You must
recover it...

You find a crown. 
What now? EXAMINE CROWN 
It is not one of the clumsy modern things with mismatched, over-sized stones
and yards of velvet and fur, but a real old crown, such as were made when
the world was young. It has slender gold links, forged by a master smith
into a delicate chain, interrupted every now and then by a spray of golden
flowers: forget-me-nots, hare bells and speedwell, their tiny petals picked
out with many-shaded blue stones, and in the heart of each, a glimmering
yellow topaz.

They are of stout blue leather with reinforced seams and a small loop on
each wristband.

What now? GET DAGGER
OK. 
What now? EXAMINE DAGGER 
Its upper edge is inlaid with a mosaic of bronze, copper and silver wire and
its bone hilt is beautifully carved. The pommel is bound with a filigree of
gold wire, and its single blade is completely blunt.

musky with the unmistakable smell of dragons. 
What now? W
You are on a bank of a bubbling lava river, watching the glowing rock ooze
downhill. The overwhelming furnace heat of this place prevents further
progress round the mountain.

You are on a dry plain of volcanic ash, and rust streaks the cinders beneath
your feet. You can see a horseshoe. 
What now? GET HORSESHOE
OK. 
What now? EXAMINE HORSESHOE 
It is quite a large horseshoe, the kind you might expect to see on a cart
horse, except that somebody has covered it in fetching blue velvet
embroidered with the legend "Good Luck" in cheap gold thread. It's made of
iron. 
What now? SE

What now? E

grass. The plain seems to go on for ever, broken only by three landmarks: a
small, steeply pointed, volcanic mountain to the north; a thin, marble tower
to the southwest; and a wide, dark forest to the east. Red flowers cover the
mound, perfuming the air with the heady smell of magik. 
What now? S 
You are in a ruined stone house, scarcely more than a heap of rubble, though

What now? EXAMINE LAMP 
Its design is archaic, along the lines of those favoured by genie-hunters,
except that this lamp is earthenware, and no amount of polishing will make
it shine. 
 
Around its sides is written ancient text which, loosely translated, means:

What now? SE
You are on a junction of several sheep tracks. The castle of Cakabol,
rumoured to be your destination, is clearly visible in the distance. Its
towers rise bright and tall above the plain, yet they are dwarfed by the
mountainside into which they have been built. Dark holes and entrances pock
the cliff face, and some have smooth, crafted edges, as though put there for
a purpose, while from others issue little plumes of smoke. 
What now? S
You are in a pothole which could lead to an extensive cave system. Large
footprints crisscross the surrounding area, joining a wide path which leads
down into the ground. 
What now? S
You are in a small copse of ash trees, their keys hanging in limp clusters
that rattle dully in the breeze. 
What now? E
You are in a forest. The trees stand in serried, lowering ranks. Darkness
breeds beneath their silent canopies and their scented needles lie thick
upon the ground. All is very, very still, as though waiting - and
watching... 
What now? N
You are in a tree clump beside a great lake whose surface glimmers with
limpid lights. Small twigs and water-hoppers dot its tranquil surface. 
What now? N 
You are in a lakeside folly in the form of a ruined Lunar temple. An evil
mist shrouds the landscape to the north, lapping about the imposing walls of
castle Cakabol. You can see a square hole and some bushes. 
What now? EXAMINE HOLE 
It is about one inch square and lined with brass. 
What now? EXAMINE BUSHES 
The bushes have grown into quite a tangle. You find a handle. You find a
key. 
What now? INSERT HANDLE 
The handle fits into the hole perfectly and there is a faint click as it
slots firmly into place. 
What now? TURN HANDLE 
The handle cranks round and round, slowly opening the great sluices that
confine the murky waters of the reservoir. 
What now? N 
You are on a dry lake bed where the muddy bottom has solidified and cracked
into uneven plates. You can see an oyster fungus. 
What now? EXAMINE OYSTER FUNGUS 
You don't see a lot of these about. It's orange, with yellow markings and
bile-green spots. You find a pearl. 
What now? EXAMINE PEARL 
For centuries, pearls like this have been called 'black', but as you study
it you can see that this is not true. It is the colour of gun metal, and has
a nacreous lustre of rainbow colours that slide fluidly across its perfect
surface. 
What now? N 
You are in a forbidding castle entrance, a great archway through the granite
walls of castle Cakabol. The building seems deserted; a near-ruin, silent as
the grave but for occasional mouse-squeaks. 
What now? E 
It's dark. 
What now? LIGHT LAMP 
OK! You are in a grand entrance hall. Its former glory has long passed by.
The great stone columns still soar up into the vaulted roof, yet they are
cracked now, and crumbling; and one has toppled over and lies, broken-backed
and dusty, across the floor. Dust hangs suspended in the air, dancing in the
sunbeams which pierce the dingy shadows of the place. 
What now? N 
You slide helplessly down a precipitate chute, which closes tightly behind
you. 
You are in a grain store. Abandoned years ago, the grain store is full of
shrivelled seed and gnawed sacking. You can see an enormous Rat. 
What now? BURY RAT
What now? N 
You are in a side alcove. Once used, by the minstrels who performed at the
castle, as a robing room, and to tune their musical instruments. You can see
a dulcimer. 
What now? GET DULCIMER
OK. 
What now? EXAMINE DULCIMER 
It is basically a shallow closed box, shaped like an isosceles triangle with
the point cut off, it has wires strung across it and a long red strap so
that it may be hung around the neck. Two delicate wooden hammers with curved
ends are laid on top of the strings. 
What now? E
You are in a west alcove of the Great Hall where the minstrels would wait
for the Castellan's summons, and those pages considered too young or willful
to attend their lords at the great feasts would be obliged to eat their
meals. 
What now? E
You are in a central area of the Great Hall, a vast room, some 120 metres
long, panelled and beamed with golden oak-wood, blackened with the smoke
from the central firepit. 
 
At the western end of the Hall is raised the great dais where the Castellan
and his honoured guests and family would sit on feast days, backed by a
rich, decaying tapestry depicting the chivalric stages of a boar hunt.
Twenty feet above the floor of the Hall, and encircling it, runs the
minstrels' gallery, its wooden timbers uncared for now and fallen into
disrepair; and from the ceiling, a little to one side of the smoke hole,
hangs an old mummers' dragon, its painted leather sides cracked and peeling.
It sways slightly, creaking quietly as it does so. A few trestle tables are
stacked along one side of the Hall, but any chairs have long since been
removed, and all seems to be peaceful and disused. A single sunbeam slants
down from the smoke hole, faraway in the high roof. 
What now? E 
You are in a far east alcove of the Great Hall where little remains of its
former glory save dust and sunbeams and a solitary, buzzing fly. 
What now? OPEN DOOR
It opens. 
What now? D
The door slams behind you. You are in a room of manacles, a small,
windowless cell whose clammy stone walls reflect a cold hostility. 
What now? E
You are in a T-junction with an arched doorway to the east and a dismal and
gloomy entrance to the west. 
What now? S
You are in a torchlit corridor, winding from north to south. Flickering
shadows play across its rough walls. 
What now? S 
You are in a dimly-lit room. A faint hissing noise echoes from its walls.
You can see Sog the Newtling.

What now? S
You are in a south alcove of a long, low room. 
What now? S
You open the door and walk through. The door slams behind you. You are in a
small alcove with a human skeleton chained to the wall in one corner. 
What now? W
You open the door and walk through. The door slams behind you. You are in a
dark corridor that runs from north to south. A small inscribed door is set
into the east wall, below an incomprehensible inscription. 
What now? S
You are in a semi-circular room, home to a host of woodlice. Their armoured
bodies crisscross every surface of the room, following mysterious yet
purposeful patterns. 
What now? W
You are in a small, high room. Like certain other parts of the castle, this
has lain empty and unused for many years. 
What now? SW
You are in a vast, lamplit circular room, almost a hundred metres across,
the high roof could only be supported by magik. A thin layer of pink and
blue mist covers the floor, swirling into eddies as you walk. 
What now? NW 
You are in a walk-in wardrobe, where a squadron of moths have made their
home. Now they erupt around you, wings whirring. You can see bracers and a
linen shirt. 
What now? GET BRACERS
OK. 
What now? EXAMINE BRACERS 
They are strong and robust with curious bionic clamps. 
What now? WEAR BRACERS 
OK. You feel stronger, but find you can't take them off again! 
What now? TAKE SHIRT
OK. 
What now? EXAMINE SHIRT 
It is heavily padded and looks extremely warm. 
What now? SE
You are in a vast, lamplit circular room, almost a hundred metres across,
the high roof could only be supported by magik. A thin layer of pink and
blue mist covers the floor, swirling into eddies as you walk. 
What now? SW
You are on a precarious platform, high up on the wall of the circular room.
The swirl of the mist against the flickering lanterns casts weird shadows on
the walls. 
What now? SW
You are in a stone stairway, slippery with moss and green algae. 
What now? W 
You are in a blocked well from which issues a foul smell of decay. You can
see some iron coins and a grating. 
What now? EXAMINE GRATING 
It is stout, stalwart, made from unbreakable cast iron and completely
immovable. 
What now? WAVE HORSESHOE 
The magnet attracts the coins, and with a clank they leap through the air to
cleave to its surface. 
What now? EXAMINE COINS 
These are an unusual form of coinage, rarely used in human societies. They
are very heavy, with complicated, and apparently meaningless, patterns
etched on their faces. Each one has a neat hole bored through its middle.
It's made of iron. 
What now? E

Scorpion man. 
What now? BURY BLETCH 
What now? N
You are in a wood-panelled library, a quiet, sunlit room, filled with the
peaceful atmosphere that comes to such places after long and tranquil years;
a feeling of knowledge, as though the room itself had drunk of the wisdom of
those who used it. You can see a scroll. 
What now? N
You open the door and walk through. As the door closes, it merges invisibly
with the wall, until no mortal eye could detect its presence. 
You are in a store vault: Really an enormous pantry, it is obviously still
in use if only by a few, for strings of onions hang from the ceiling and
several jars of preserves and pickles stand on the rickety shelves. You can
see some meat. 
What now? W
You are in a castle kitchen. A sickly-sweet smell permeates through from the
corridor to the north, yet the kitchen itself is clean and neat, save for a
thick layer of grime over everything. The pots and pans hang on their hooks,
well-ordered and only slightly tarnished. Unburnt logs lie in the great
hearth, only needing the spark of flint and tinder to bring them to life
again, and beside them the mighty spit stands idle. The platters are stacked
neatly in their racks and the huge scrubbed-pine table is bare and empty. It
is as if everyone, having finished their work, was suddenly spirited away,
never to return - and several purple-red stains on the floor suggest that
the spiriting was not done gently. 
What now? S
You are in a cold junction between three passages. Condensation drips from
the roof. 
What now? NW
You are in a basement with oak walls, once the servants' hall, where they
would take their meals when the work was done, having saved the best food,
as always, for themselves. But it is silent and deserted now. 
What now? W
You are in a grand entrance hall. Its former glory has long passed by. The
great stone columns still soar up into the vaulted roof, yet they are
cracked now, and crumbling; and one has toppled over and lies, broken-backed

sunbeams which pierce the dingy shadows of the place.

You are in a forbidding castle entrance, a great archway through the granite
walls of castle Cakabol. The building seems deserted; a near-ruin, silent as
the grave but for occasional mouse-squeaks. 
What now? SW 
A heavy metal gate clangs ominously shut behind you. You are in a wide
gateway in the wall of castle Cakabol. It is surrounded by a tasteful
montage of bones and sports a "Beware of the Rat" sign. You can see a gate
of metal which is securely locked. 
What now? UNLOCK GATE 
What with? KEY
The gate creaks open and the key falls away, disintegrating in a shower of
rusty flakes. 
What now? SW
You are on a junction of several sheep tracks. The castle of Cakabol,
rumoured to be your destination, is clearly visible in the distance. Its
towers rise bright and tall above the plain, yet they are dwarfed by the

You are on a junction of several sheep tracks. The castle of Cakabol,
rumoured to be your destination, is clearly visible in the distance. Its
towers rise bright and tall above the plain, yet they are dwarfed by the
mountainside into which they have been built. Dark holes and entrances pock
the cliff face, and some have smooth, crafted edges, as though put there for
a purpose, while from others issue little plumes of smoke.

walls of castle Cakabol. The building seems deserted; a near-ruin, silent as

You are in a grand entrance hall. Its former glory has long passed by. The
great stone columns still soar up into the vaulted roof, yet they are
cracked now, and crumbling; and one has toppled over and lies, broken-backed
and dusty, across the floor. Dust hangs suspended in the air, dancing in the
sunbeams which pierce the dingy shadows of the place. 
What now? E

central area of the Great Hall, a vast room, some 120 metres long, panelled
and beamed with golden oak-wood, blackened with the smoke from the central
firepit. 
 
At the western end of the Hall is raised the great dais where the Castellan
and his honoured guests and family would sit on feast days, backed by a
rich, decaying tapestry depicting the chivalric stages of a boar hunt.
Twenty feet above the floor of the Hall, and encircling it, runs the
minstrels' gallery, its wooden timbers uncared for now and fallen into
disrepair; and from the ceiling, a little to one side of the smoke hole,
hangs an old mummers' dragon, its painted leather sides cracked and peeling.
It sways slightly, creaking quietly as it does so. A few trestle tables are
stacked along one side of the Hall, but any chairs have long since been
removed, and all seems to be peaceful and disused. A single sunbeam slants
down from the smoke hole, faraway in the high roof. 
What now? E
You are in a far east alcove of the Great Hall where little remains of its
former glory save dust and sunbeams and a solitary, buzzing fly.

her chemicals and instruments are securely locked in diamond-glass cabinets,

One cabinet bears a neat array of her finished products, each labelled in
careful hand with such legends as: "For to Banish the Nits", "To Make Whole
the Half-hearted", and "A Sure-fire Cure for Caries". You can see pink
pills, a chalk chunk and Nezzon the Healer. Nezzon's eyes gleam: "Goods for
barter! Goods for trade!" she exclaims, "Many have need of my wares when
a-questing, adventurer, so buy now while you have the chance!"

Dwarf. "Oh *@!!*! - Not another puling adventurer!" he thunders, "I had

to contribute my poor mite to your quest - even though it is bound to be
hopeless - and tell you that there is a spell hidden in these caves which
can turn an acorn into a bridge". Bostog's mouth writhes briefly and you
realize that he is trying to smile, an exercise to which he is almost
entirely unaccustomed. "I must go now", he says dejectedly. "I won't bid you
farewell, because you probably won't. Nobody ever does in these caves". And
he shuffles away, humming a whimsical little dirge.

well-ordered and only slightly tarnished. Unburnt logs lie in the great
hearth, only needing the spark of flint and tinder to bring them to life
again, and beside them the mighty spit stands idle. The platters are stacked
neatly in their racks and the huge scrubbed-pine table is bare and empty. It
is as if everyone, having finished their work, was suddenly spirited away,
never to return - and several purple-red stains on the floor suggest that
the spiriting was not done gently. 
What now? N
You are in a stinking corridor. The wooden panels and once-shiny floor seem
to exude an all-pervading odour of decay. 
What now? N
You open the door and walk through. The door slams behind you. You are in a
central area of the Great Hall, a vast room, some 120 metres long, panelled
and beamed with golden oak-wood, blackened with the smoke from the central
firepit. 
 
At the western end of the Hall is raised the great dais where the Castellan
and his honoured guests and family would sit on feast days, backed by a
rich, decaying tapestry depicting the chivalric stages of a boar hunt.
Twenty feet above the floor of the Hall, and encircling it, runs the
minstrels' gallery, its wooden timbers uncared for now and fallen into
disrepair; and from the ceiling, a little to one side of the smoke hole,
hangs an old mummers' dragon, its painted leather sides cracked and peeling.
It sways slightly, creaking quietly as it does so. A few trestle tables are
stacked along one side of the Hall, but any chairs have long since been
removed, and all seems to be peaceful and disused. A single sunbeam slants
down from the smoke hole, faraway in the high roof. 
What now? E 
You are in a far east alcove of the Great Hall where little remains of its
former glory save dust and sunbeams and a solitary, buzzing fly.

You open the door and walk through. The door slams behind you. You are in a
stained room, its walls and floor blotched with a smelly residue that
trickles from cracks in its northern wall. Further stains have dribbled down

You are on a north wall of a chasm which is much too wide to jump. Mist
surges in the depths. 
What now? DROP ACORN
OK. 
What now? READ SCROLL 
It is made of crisp new parchment and bound with a red satin ribbon. The
writing on it is thin and spiky, and its heading reads: "A Spell for
Chasms". As you read the scroll the acorn expands, arcing up through the
air, across and down again, forming a bridge over the chasm. 
What now? S 
You are in the Helix of Het. This strange collection of room-sculptures were
said to embody the entire history of the world; and it was through her study
of them and her practice of the forbidden rites that Het gained her
knowledge of things to come, and so nearly overthrew the world and all
contained therein... You can see a bridge over the chasm.

column that drenches the ledge with icy spray. You can see a pool of acid. 
What now? DROP CHALK 
OK. 
For a few moments, the pool fizzles frantically, then becomes still. The
chalk and the acid have reacted together to form a harmless solution.

You are by a stone statue of a God, possibly Zog of Snortlenose, but nobody
is really sure any more, because all his followers got so fed up with the
way he kept answering their prayers by doing exactly what they said and not
what they meant, that they became Socialists instead. Zog himself went back
to his former profession of dreaming up new forms of pollution to sell to
Mankind for a huge profit, and is doing very nicely, thank you.

socks. Mice scuttle tamely over all, gnawing at the titbits they glean from

You are in a secret bedroom occupied by an enormous four-poster bed with
crimson curtains. Elegant tapestries cover the walls and a thick rug lies on

chairs. The room smells of potpourri, lavender and hot spiced wine.

great stone columns still soar up into the vaulted roof, yet they are
cracked now, and crumbling; and one has toppled over and lies, broken-backed

sunbeams which pierce the dingy shadows of the place.

walls of castle Cakabol. The building seems deserted; a near-ruin, silent as
the grave but for occasional mouse-squeaks.

a tasteful montage of bones and sports a "Beware of the Rat" sign. You can

You are on a junction of several sheep tracks. The castle of Cakabol,
rumoured to be your destination, is clearly visible in the distance. Its
towers rise bright and tall above the plain, yet they are dwarfed by the
mountainside into which they have been built. Dark holes and entrances pock
the cliff face, and some have smooth, crafted edges, as though put there for
a purpose, while from others issue little plumes of smoke.

What now? OUT
The door slams behind you. You are on a plain of grass beside a marble
tower, a near-cylinder of polished white rock: ten meters wide at the base
and narrowing subtly near the top. It seems impossibly high. Looking
carefully, you find the letters "Xiiz" carved into its smooth side at
head-height.

blueberry and heather, and crisscrossed with little meandering sheep tracks.
It has a wild and lonely smell. 
What now? E
You are on a grassy mound which rises a few metres above a sea of waving
grass. The plain seems to go on for ever, broken only by three landmarks: a
small, steeply pointed, volcanic mountain to the north; a thin, marble tower
to the southwest; and a wide, dark forest to the east. Red flowers cover the
mound, perfuming the air with the heady smell of magik. You can see a box.

You are in a ruined stone house, scarcely more than a heap of rubble, though
a deep alcove survives in the remains of one overgrown wall. This house

iron coins, a crown, a medallion, a pearl, an emerald, a book, a black ball,
a horseshoe, pink pills, a scroll, rare spices, a sword, a cloak, a
crucifix, leather gloves, a ring, a suit of chain mail, a linen shirt,
wellington boots, an axe and a dagger.

footprints crisscross the surrounding area, joining a wide path which leads
down into the ground. A sibilant voice hisses from nowhere, "Satarh". 
What now? N
You are on a junction of several sheep tracks. The castle of Cakabol,
rumoured to be your destination, is clearly visible in the distance. Its
towers rise bright and tall above the plain, yet they are dwarfed by the
mountainside into which they have been built. Dark holes and entrances pock
the cliff face, and some have smooth, crafted edges, as though put there for
a purpose, while from others issue little plumes of smoke. 
What now? NE

a tasteful montage of bones and sports a "Beware of the Rat" sign. You can

walls of castle Cakabol. The building seems deserted; a near-ruin, silent as
the grave but for occasional mouse-squeaks. 
What now? E
You are in a grand entrance hall. Its former glory has long passed by. The
great stone columns still soar up into the vaulted roof, yet they are
cracked now, and crumbling; and one has toppled over and lies, broken-backed
and dusty, across the floor. Dust hangs suspended in the air, dancing in the
sunbeams which pierce the dingy shadows of the place. 
What now? E
You are in a basement with oak walls, once the servants' hall, where they
would take their meals when the work was done, having saved the best food,
as always, for themselves. But it is silent and deserted now.

You are in a stinking corridor. The wooden panels and once-shiny floor seem

You open the door and walk through. The door slams behind you. You are in a
central area of the Great Hall, a vast room, some 120 metres long, panelled
and beamed with golden oak-wood, blackened with the smoke from the central
firepit. 
 
At the western end of the Hall is raised the great dais where the Castellan
and his honoured guests and family would sit on feast days, backed by a
rich, decaying tapestry depicting the chivalric stages of a boar hunt.
Twenty feet above the floor of the Hall, and encircling it, runs the
minstrels' gallery, its wooden timbers uncared for now and fallen into
disrepair; and from the ceiling, a little to one side of the smoke hole,
hangs an old mummers' dragon, its painted leather sides cracked and peeling.
It sways slightly, creaking quietly as it does so. A few trestle tables are
stacked along one side of the Hall, but any chairs have long since been
removed, and all seems to be peaceful and disused. A single sunbeam slants
down from the smoke hole, faraway in the high roof.

You are in a castle kitchen. A sickly-sweet smell permeates through from the
corridor to the north, yet the kitchen itself is clean and neat, save for a
thick layer of grime over everything. The pots and pans hang on their hooks,
well-ordered and only slightly tarnished. Unburnt logs lie in the great
hearth, only needing the spark of flint and tinder to bring them to life
again, and beside them the mighty spit stands idle. The platters are stacked
neatly in their racks and the huge scrubbed-pine table is bare and empty. It
is as if everyone, having finished their work, was suddenly spirited away,
never to return - and several purple-red stains on the floor suggest that
the spiriting was not done gently.

I don't understand what you mean by the word "must". 
What now? ERASE LINE 
You erase the line in a choking of red chalk dust. 
What now? S
You open the door and walk through. The door slams behind you. You are in a
room with many doors which all look exactly the same. 
What now? E 
You open the door and walk through. The door slams behind you. You are
surrounded by thousands of brilliant flashing lights, which dazzle your eyes
and effectively blind you. 
What now? CAST EXTINGUISH 
You have 37 hit points left. 
The room is plunged into darkness - and for the space of seven heartbeats
you can see nothing save the phantom images at the back of your eyes. 
What now? LOOK
You are in a room of flashing lights. Multicoloured squares cover the floor,
flickering hypnotically round your feet as distorted sound booms out. 
What now? E 
You are on a vault containing a great pedestal. It must be the central vault
of Cakabol. You can see the Moon Crystal of Baskalos. 
What now? GET MOON CRYSTAL 
As you pick up the crystal, two dragons appear from the side rooms. They
lumber crabwise across the floor and circle you menacingly, cutting off any
escape. 
What now? WAVE FAN 
This must be a magical fan, for a few gentle waves call forth a howling
gale, which whistles round the room! 
And blows the dragons' fire back at them, enveloping them in a sea of
flames. Through the conflagration, you can just make out their bulky figures
staggering backwards. 
What now? W

You open the door and walk through. The door slams behind you. You are in a
room with many doors which all look exactly the same. 
What now? N
You open the door and walk through. The door slams behind you. It's dark. 
What now? LIGHT LAMP
OK! You are in a red room, decorated entirely in shades of red. 
What now? N
You are on a bridge over a sea of flames within a crystal cavern. Heat
reflects from every gleaming wall. Four fragile walkways arc through the
shimmering air to meet at a tiny platform, supported high in the dead centre
of the cave. Gouts of glowing magma jet upwards, splashing onto the rocks
all around before falling back into the liquid fire below. The noise and
vibration are terrifying, but the central platform where you stand is
clearly protected by powerful magik and is probably safe. 
What now? N
You are in a yellow sulphur room, carved out of solid volcanic sulphur.
Steam escaping from the room next door swirls around its upper reaches,
mingling with other gases that vent themselves from numerous small holes,
the whole poisonous mixture finally escaping through a hole in the high
ceiling. 
What now? U
You slide helplessly down a precipitate chute, which closes tightly behind
you. 
You are in a yellow hole, its sides streaked with sulphurous deposits and
tumescent crystals. It reeks with the bad-egg smell of volcanic gases, and
acrid fumes sear your nose and lungs. 
What now? D
You slide helplessly down a precipitate chute, which closes tightly behind
you. 
You are in a volcano crater covered by shattered black rocks. The ground
seems to tremble slightly and there is a whiff of sulphur in the air. 
What now? S
You are on a crater rim towering high above the landscape. Sulphurous fumes
swirl past. 
What now? SE
You are on a rocky path up a volcano peak, zigzagging between leaning
pillars of jagged lava. The ground is sharp beneath your feet, like dirty
grey coral. 
What now? SE
You are on a stony path across dry cinders and ashes, which puff into the
air and swirl lazily around your ankles. 
What now? SE
You are on a steep rock slide which tumbles down in a river of shattered
rock from the soaring precipices above. 
What now? S
You are on a wide, flat grassy plain, baked by the yellow sun. 
What now? W 
You are on a grassy mound which rises a few metres above a sea of waving
grass. The plain seems to go on for ever, broken only by three landmarks: a
small, steeply pointed, volcanic mountain to the north; a thin, marble tower
to the southwest; and a wide, dark forest to the east. Red flowers cover the
mound, perfuming the air with the heady smell of magik. You can see a purple
potion and a box. 
What now? GET POTION
OK. 
What now? DRINK POTION 
You feel stronger. 
What now? S 
You are in a ruined stone house, scarcely more than a heap of rubble, though
a deep alcove survives in the remains of one overgrown wall. This house
seems an ideal place to cache your loot. You can see some silver bars, some
iron coins, a crown, a medallion, a necklace, a pearl, an emerald, a book, a
black ball, a horseshoe, a scroll, rare spices, a sword, a cloak, leather
gloves, a ring, a shield, a suit of chain mail, a linen shirt, wellington
boots, a gas mask, a flask, some tubing, an axe, a crowbar and a dagger.
Congratulations! You have completed your quest, restored the Red Moon, and
saved the Kingdom of Baskalos! 
You score 1000 out of 1000 and are a grandmaster Adventurer. You have 50 hit
points left.
