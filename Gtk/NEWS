2005-08-XX - 1.3 (The "Keeping up with the Baldwins" release.)

Bugfixes

- Don't assume that "/" is the directory separator when building the
  config filename.

Other changes

- Updated the README file; GlkLevel9 supports graphics now.

- Usability fixes for the file selector. It always has a default
  widget now, and it remembers the most recently used directory.

2005-07-31 - 1.2 (The "Raising shields" release.)

Bugfixes

- When using #save and #restore, the file selector dialog didn't work.
  That was apparently because the game kept running in the background,
  so os_input() was called again. I guess calling gtk_main() while in
  a file dialog is a really bad idea...

- Don't crash if quitting while waiting for keypress to skip picture.

Other changes

- Flush the output before waiting for keypress to skip picture. This
  could make the input prompt non-editable, however, so now the input
  buffer is always scrolled and made editable on os_input.

- Try to make the data filename absolute before loading the file. This
  should ensure that the same filename is stored in savegames,
  regardless of if the user specified it with a file chooser or on the
  command line.

2005-07-29 - 1.1 (The "More beta than schmeta" release.)

Bugfixes

- Minor fixes to the file chooser dialog.

Other changes

- We used to execute only one game instruction every time the program
  was idle, but it's probably more efficient (and not noticeable to the
  user) to run several. Now we run up to 20.

2005-07-28 - 1.0 (The "Beta Schmeta" release.)

Well, it seems to be working now, but I don't know much about the
Level 9 games...
